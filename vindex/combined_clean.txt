Furthermore, sometimes adding promotions can damage KPIs instead of accelerating them.By modifying the price on one item, the neighboring items also get triggered and the entire inventory now requires a robust pricing strategy
. Thus, the fine-tuning of portfolio pricing architecture becomes extremely challenging, given the millions of data points one needs to consider before indulging in promotions.The SolutionTo increase the KPI of a particular product category, be it volume, revenue, or profit, the retailer needs to deploy optimization models that consider both the items’ elasticity and their cross-elasticity with similar items

. A few of them include:-Multiple SKUs and channels-The complexity of products-The fact that shoppers are more aware of prices-Shoppers are less loyal to brands and more inclined towards deeper promotionsSo let’s take a look at how retail businesses canaccelerate inventory turns, eliminate stock-outs, and maintain GMs through effective promo planning–1
. Adapt to inflation by setting the right promotionsAs inventories and supply chains continue to deal with constraints even after post-COVID, retailers can also raise margins by not resorting to clearance pricing much. By switching to lesser stocks, retailers can reduce the problem of seasonal inventory overstocks, thereby ensuring lesser discounts and markdowns to clear space for further merchandise.Retailers need to bring about some equilibrium in clearing inventories and pulling back on discounts
. Despite inflationary pressures, retailers can drive revenue in the following manner:Getting more granular in promoting the entire assortmentResorting to a stronger connection between promotions and current inventoriesUnderstanding the customer purchasing capacities of different channels during inflationAs a result, retailers can better combat inflation across the entire buying and product merchandising cycle
. In short, retailers must deal with inflationary pressures by adhering to acceptable pricing thresholds.2. Switch to Personalized PromotionsRather than turning to an average price spike across their entire product mix, retailers should take a more personalized approach to better resonate with prices as per consumers’ value perceptions
. This allows them to reshuffle the value mix across their product assortments.To deal with high supply costs and inflationary pressures, a more granular pricing strategy should take into consideration a myriad of customer and product sensitivities, inflationary effects on consumers and the overall economy of that channel, and inventory positions
. In terms of SKUs and categories of products, retailers need to segment their inventory pricing based on price elasticity and margin dynamics.Increasing the price across the assortment while resorting to personalized promotions and loyalty options could be a good way of selling inelastic products that are volatile during inflation
. This can improve the relationship with high-value customers while easing out some margin pressures by reducing the frequency of mass promos and preventing markdowns.Segmentation of the assortment and personalization of promotions need to be done repeatedly since the response of customers and inflationary outcomes will change over time
. Retailers also need to ensure continuous monitoring to identify the categories and products that have to deal with the highest margin pressures and which shoppers are likely to be sensitive to price modifications.3
. Analyzing Price ElasticityOne of the best ways to ensure optimal promotional pricing is to generate demand and spur quick change to a business’s top and bottom lines with strategic markdown optimization.One of the most basic retail concepts is that when an item’s price goes down, its sales go up. Price elasticity is used to measure the relationship between price and demand and how they affect each other.If a product is elastic, a slight modification in its price will highly impact its demand
. If a product is inelastic, its pricing may not change its demand much. Understanding the elasticity of your item is essential to know the demand curve of your inventory.With advanced retail price optimization solutions, businesses can efficiently calculate endless elasticity values and seamlessly change prices based on demand dynamics. The result: protected margins, better forecasting capabilities, and optimal prices to drive profitable demand.4
. Resort to Conditional PromosIf retailers want to set promotions while protecting their margins, switching to conditional promos is a good choice for effective markdown optimization. Rather than running a straight deal like “$10 off any purchase” or “15% off all products,” implement limitations or conditions that customers need to meet to redeem the offer: “Buy 10 items and receive 40% off.”Businesses may also utilize this strategy without putting the first product on sale
. For example: “This month, buy a blouse at the full price of $80 and each additional pair is just $60.”Other conditional promotions involve seasonal or limited-time discounts that we often see during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.Final ThoughtsThere are several ways retailers can increase their sales while maintaining their margins
. All of the aforementioned approaches require the adoption of price optimization processes, including data management, algorithmic decision-making, and advanced predictive analytics.IA’s PriceSmartuses the blend of AI and ML technologies to forecast the impact of every lifecycle pricing or promo campaign based on millions of data points such as seasonality, customer behavior, unprecedented events, and competitors’ actions

Everything You Need to Know About ABC Inventory Management Are you struggling to identify your most profitable products? Do you find it hard to focus your inventory efforts? ABC inventory analysis can help. It categorizes your stock based on its impact on revenue. This way, you can allocate resources more effectively. Unsure if you’re investing in the right products?ABC analysis lets you prioritize inventory management of high-value items. It helps you make decisions that benefit your bottom line
. Let’s get to it in detail!What is ABC Inventory Management?Imagine running a business with hundreds or even thousands of products. How do you track which inventory value is crucial and which isn’t? This is whereABC inventoryplanning comes in.ABC method of inventory categorizes items based on their value to a business. It’s like sorting your closet—you have your favorite outfits, your regular wear, and those clothes you hardly touch.There are three categories:A items are the superstars
. They generate the most revenue and profit. Think of your favorite jeans or a popular smartphone. These items demand close attention.B items are the solid performers. They contribute significantly but not as much as A items. These might be like your reliable sneakers.C items are the fillers. They have lower value and contribute less to overall profit. Imagine those extra buttons or spare socks.To determine which items fall into each category, businesses calculate the annual value of each product
. This involves factors like sales volume and profit margin. The highest-value items become A items, and so on. We’ll explore these categories in detail later in this blog. Keep reading!Why is ABC Analysis in Inventory Management Useful?ABC inventorymanagement system is an essential tool for modern businesses. It offers a structured way for stock management and resources efficiently. By categorizing inventory into A, B, and C items, companies can focus on what matters most
. Let’s dive deeper into why this method is so helpful.Focus on What MattersThe primary benefit of ABC inventory is its ability to help businesses focus. A items represent the most valuable products. These are the goods that generate the most revenue or have the highest turnover. By identifying these items, companies can allocate resources more effectively. For example, a grocery store might classify everyday essentials like milk and bread as A items
. These products are in high demand and contribute significantly to profit. Focusing on managing inventory of these items ensures they are always in stock. It also means that companies can avoid costly stockouts.A items demand special attention. They require regular monitoring and quick replenishment. Companies can’t afford to run out of these products. Therefore, businesses often implement tighter controls on A items. This includes frequent inventory checks and more accurate forecasting
. By doing so, they reduce the risk of losing sales due to stockouts.Cost ControlAnother significant advantage of ABC inventory is cost control. Managing A items efficiently can save a company a lot of money. Overstocking can be just as detrimental as running out of stock. Excess inventory items ties up capital that could be used elsewhere. It also increases storage costs and the risk of obsolescence
. By focusing on A items, businesses can prevent both overstocking and stockouts.ABC inventory allows for better financial management. Companies can invest more in their top-performing products without worrying about wastage. This strategic allocation of resources ensures that the company’s money is spent wisely. It also improves cash flow, which is vital for the business’s overall health.Improved Decision MakingABCinventorydoesn’t just help with day-to-day operations
. It also plays a critical role in strategic decision-making. Understanding the value of each item in the inventory allows companies to make informed choices. This could involve decisions about pricing, promotions, or even discontinuing a product.For instance, products classified as A items may be prioritized for promotional efforts. Since these items generate the most revenue, boosting their sales could have a significant impact on the company’s bottom line
. On the other hand, C items, which are less important, might be phased out or given less attention. This approach ensures that resources are used efficiently, maximizing profitability.For example, A items like milk and bread are staples that customers expect to find. Therefore, the store might run promotions on these items to attract more customers. Meanwhile, speciality cheeses, which might be classified as C items, are stocked in smaller quantities
.

. Supplier reliability also plays a role. If a supplier is inconsistent, even an A item might need to be stocked more carefully.A Tool for SuccessABC inventory is more than just a classification system.

. Whether it’s a grocery store managing perishable goods or a tech company handling electronic components, ABC inventory provides a clear framework for success.The ABC Inventory Classification MethodTheABC classification methodis a strategic approach used in inventory management. It helps businesses prioritize resources by categorizing products based on their value
. This method is essential for maintaining efficiency and profitability.How Does the ABC Inventory Analysis Classification Work?The ABC classification method divides inventory into three categories: A, B, and C. Each category represents a different level of importance
. This system is straightforward yet powerful.Category A:High-value items that contribute the most to revenue.Category B:Moderate-value items with average importance.Category C:Low-value items that are less critical to the business.Each product in a company’s inventory is analyzed and placed into one of these categories
. The classification is usually based on criteria such as revenue, consumption rate, or the product’s overall impact on the business.Category A: High-Value ItemsCategory A includes the most important products in the inventory. These items typically represent a small portion of the total inventory but contribute significantly to revenue. Managing these items effectively is crucial.Companies often focus the most resources on Category A items. This includes regular monitoring and precise forecasting
. Stockouts of these items can lead to significant losses, so they require tight control. The goal is to ensure that these high-value items are always available to meet customer demand.Category B: Moderate-Value ItemsCategory B consists of products that are important but not as critical as Category A items. They represent a larger portion of the inventory but contribute less to revenue than A items
. These products require a balanced approach to management.Businesses often adopt a more moderate strategy for Category B items. They are monitored regularly, but not with the same intensity as Category A items. The focus is on maintaining a steady supply without overstocking. This ensures that the company’s resources are used efficiently.Category C: Low-Value ItemsCategory C includes products that have the least impact on revenue
. These items usually make up the largest portion of the inventory but contribute the least financially. Managing these items requires a different approach.Companies often minimize resources spent on Category C items. These products are stocked in smaller quantities, and their management is less frequent
. The focus is on reducing costs associated with holding these items while ensuring they are available when needed.Criteria for ClassificationThe classification of items into A, B, or C categories is based on specific criteria. These criteria vary depending on the business and its priorities
. Common factors include:Revenue Contribution:How much each product contributes to overall sales.Consumption Rate:The frequency at which products are used or sold.Inventory Turnover:How quickly products move through inventory.Supply Chain Reliability:The dependability of suppliers for each product.By analyzing these factors, businesses can accurately categorize their inventory
. This ensures that resources are allocated effectively and that the most critical items are prioritized.How to Implement ABC Inventory?Implementing ABC inventory is a straightforward process.

Handling Unforeseen Events and Tourist Index Adaptable demand forecasting models are required to address events such as spontaneous local festivals, sudden tourism influx, or unexpected market shifts that are not historically documented. Neural networks models can learn from real-time data and adjust their predictions accordingly
. For instance, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or attention-based models capture sequential information and learn patterns from non stationary data, enabling the system to respond to new, unrecorded events. Long-term Impact Assessment and Refinement AI-based retail demand forecasting systems continuously learn and adapt from new data. After a rare product launch or unforeseen event, such models analyze the longer-term impact and adjust future forecasts based on these insights
. Reinforcement learning techniques help refine forecasting models by incorporating feedback loops from actual post-event sales data, enhancing the accuracy of future predictions. Ultimately, the strength of AI in demand forecasting lies in its ability to adapt, learn from new information, and handle diverse and dynamic datasets to provide more accurate predictions, especially in the face of rare and unforeseen events
. By continuously learning and adapting in real-time, these models equip businesses with actionable insights, aiding in risk assessment, dynamic forecasting, and targeted marketing strategies tailored to diverse economic conditions. AI Retail Demand Forecasting in the Real World Beyond the above rare events, economic changes exert a profound influence on consumer behavior, causing a direct ripple effect in sales patterns
. During periods of economic prosperity, consumers tend to embrace a more liberal spending mindset, indulging in nonessential purchases and luxury items. In contrast, economic downturns prompt a shift in consumer behavior toward frugality, where essential goods take precedence over discretionary spending. Integrating macroeconomic factors into sales forecasting is pivotal for accurate predictions. AI/ML play a pivotal role by sifting through extensive historical sales data and economic indicators

AI Retail Demand Forecasting: Anomaly Detection Techniques, Corrections, and Beyond Suryavamsi GExpert Data ScientistThis is the fourth in a series of blogs pulling back the curtain on Impact Analytics ForecastSmart™ AI-based demand forecasting software.Unusual Event, Interesting Incident,Erroneous Data or Unwanted Noise?What is an anomaly?In the ever-changing world of retail, when we analyze different client datasets, sometimes we detect inconsistent data points or patterns that deviate suddenly and
data points or patterns that deviate suddenly and significantly from the norm
. These unexpected deviations or occurrences are called anomalies.We can understand this via an example:Consider an e-commerce website with a web server that logs data related to incoming requests, such as the number of customer requests per minute.Expected Behavior—The incoming requests typically follow a predictable, wavy pattern that varies with the day (weekday or weekend) and time (normal business or peak hours).Anomalous Behavior—If the website experiences an unexpected surge in traffic, far beyond
an unexpected surge in traffic, far beyond what is usual for that day and time, such a spike in incoming requests stands out as an anomaly.Sometimes these outliers are just noise or erroneous data, and thus not cause for significant concern
. Such anomalies may be quickly adjusted or simply deleted to improve the data quality and create a cleaner dataset, which may then be passed to the algorithms to produce more accurate predictions.Types of AnomaliesGlobal OutliersA global outlier is a data point in a specific time period that is located abnormally far from its neighboring points or other values in the time series.Above is the sales pattern for the Canned Protein category of a leading American warehouse club chain
. The global outlier — approximately 51,000 units sold on August 29, 2019 — was due to panic buying immediately after four US states (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina) declared states of emergence as Hurricane Dorian bore down on them.Subsequence OutliersSubsequence outliers are a series of data points in a specific time period whose collective pattern is unusual.Above is the quantity-sold pattern of a frozen meals item from a leading American warehouse club chain
. The collective outlier points, marked in the pink zone, occurred from February 23-29, 2020, due to panic buying brought on by looming store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Anomaly Detection TechniquesSTL DecompositionSTL decomposition refers to seasonal-trend decomposition procedure using LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing), which gives us three components: seasonal, trend, and residue
. We can detect anomalies by analyzing the deviation of the residue component and applying a cutoff or threshold.Isolation ForestModels must be trained to detect outliers in data that return 1 for normal versus -1 for anomaly. Also, the outlier_fraction (a trial-and-error metric) needs to be set to estimate the proportion of outliers in the data, and we need to ensure there is enough data available so the algorithm detects sufficient variance to identify what qualifies as an anomaly
. We could add additional features to make the model more sophisticated, but that typically degrades computational performance.K-MeansK-Means clusters normal data; data that do not belong to any cluster, or small isolated clusters, may be marked as potential anomalies.AutoencodersThis is a deep learning-based technique deployed on high-dimensional datasets with complex and nonlinear patterns
. We train the model by specifying the number of neurons in input, hidden, and output layers, then use it to predict the anomaly score for each observation in the test data. This can be implemented using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch or PyOD (a Python module that builds autoencoders internally with few user inputs.)Z ScoreThis method uses the standard deviation metric
. Points that exceed two or three standard deviations from the mean may be considered anomalies.Density-BasedDensity-based methods estimate the probability distribution of the data and then identify the data points unlikely to have come from that distribution; anomalies are defined as observations of low probability
. Below are some useful techniques:DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clusters data points based on density (outliers that do not belong to any cluster).LOF (Local Outlier Factor) measures the local density around each data point and identifies points with significantly lower densities as anomalies.Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCD)BOCD is an online algorithm that uses Bayesian statistics to model the underlying probability distribution of the data; it detects
probability distribution of the data; it detects real-time changes as new data points are added to a time series
. This method can detect multiple changes, making it useful in identifying complex anomalies involving multiple events or sources.Statistical Methods for Anomaly CorrectionUsing mean to smooth out the anomalyTo even out a sudden outlier peak, take an average of the normal data points in the same period from historical years (to follow similar seasonality, etc.), thus adjusting the outlier to match the original distribution.In the below graph, the anomaly has been adjusted by taking the mean of the Catfish
been adjusted by taking the mean of the Catfish Sales for the same anomalous month but from previous years.WinsorizationReplace the extreme values with percentiles; the trimmed minimum and maximum
. A typical strategy is to set all outliers to a specified percentile of the data. For example: 90 percent winsorization sets all the data below the 5th percentile to the 5th percentile value and sets all data above the 95th percentile to the 95th percentile value.TrimmingThis removes the extreme values, a certain fraction of the data from both sides
. For example: To obtain a 5 percent trimmed mean, take the mean of the 5 – 95 percent range and discard the 5 percent observations on the low and high ends.Specific Business Use CasesThe above graph displays the quantity-sold pattern for an e-commerce channel of an American multinational luxury fashion company. The huge spike (marked in red, ~32,000 units) corresponds to the COVID-19 pandemic when brick-and-mortar stores were closed
. It also represents the Cyber Monday effect.Depending on your goals, you can train the model on the anomaly (to adapt to new patterns) or not (to remove anomalous peaks).This graph compares the quantity sold from all transactions (orange) versus porter transactions (blue); the porter contribution can vary across different time periods.For example: The intensity and contribution of porter transactions to total quantity sold is high between 202142 to 202204; in other time windows, it is on the lower side
. These spikes are due to “power shopping” by tourists buying products in bulk quantities.If your objective is to capture normal (nontourist) demand, you’ll identify and remove these anomalous (huge bulk/porter transactions) peaks. The erratic data pattern goes away, and it becomes easier to build an accurate model to make predictions.ConclusionYour ability to quickly identify, attribute, and correct anomalies is more important than ever
. This requires a robust, automated anomaly detection framework—manual processes are neither fast, scalable, nor accurate—that enables retailers to detect unusual shopping patterns and various discrepancies, and then make informed business decisions.Take the Next StepImpact Analytics ForecastSmart™ is an excellent platform for demand forecasting in general and anomaly detection in particular.Impact Analytics ForecastSmart—Take advantage of advanced machine learning algorithms to generate precise forecasts

AI Retail Demand Forecasts: Cold Start Modeling for New Retail Products Amal SatheeshExpert Data ScientistThis is the third in a series of blogs pulling back the curtain on Impact Analytics ForecastSmart™ AI-based demand forecasting software.Today’s average retail consumer is highly aspirational and eager to keep up with rapidly changing fashion trends. To maintain an edge in this scenario, fashion brands must provide consumers with an ever-changing assortment
. But this brings with it its own set of problems, one of the most prominent being the challenge of accuratelyforecasting demand.Why Is Cold Start Modeling Difficult?Every forecast framework essentially estimates two aspects of demand.Sales pattern—This is the ebb and flow of sales over regular time intervals (weekly/ monthly/quarterly)
. This aspect captures seasonal behavior, elasticities, and the response to irregular factors such as events.Rate of sales, or scale—This tells us how much the product sells, on average, without considering seasonal patterns
. Scale is affected by factors such as buy quantities, store penetration, marketing budget, and product appeal.Estimating these two factors effectively is necessary to create an accurate demand forecast for any product.For products with sufficient sales histories, regular statistical models infer the above aspects from the history itself and generate a forecast
. Obviously, this is not viable in the case of a new product that has no data; hence, we’re in a “cold start” situation.So, to estimate the sales pattern and scale for a new product, we must employ two separate, additional processes:AI-driven SKU similarity detection—for pattern estimationDiffusion algorithms—for scalePattern Estimation Through Similar SKU IdentificationSimilar SKUs tend to behave similarly; this is the foundation on which we build a new SKU pattern estimation.Due to their need to
a new SKU pattern estimation.Due to their need to constantly churn out new assortments, retailers often create products by modifying prior SKUs
. Identifying these similar SKUs is the key to estimating how a new SKU will behave in the market. This is where AI steps in to provide accurate product similarity mapping.AI-based clustering algorithms identify similarly behaving SKUs by considering factors such as product attribute data ( color, material, etc.), pricing information, launch dates, store penetration, life cycle information, and marketing data, then groups these SKUs into distinct clusters
. Computer vision algorithms can also play a crucial role here by extracting product attributes directly from image data, making the process more accurate and faster.These AI clustering algorithms create an accurate, well separated, optimum number of clusters containing similarly behaving SKUs
. Sales patterns for a new SKU may now be effectively estimated from the behavior of SKUs in the cluster.Using Diffusion Algorithms to Estimate Rate of SalesA product’s rate of sales, or scale, depends on various factors such as buy quantity, price point, store penetration, marketing, and rate of customer penetration. Buy quantity, pricing, store penetration, and marketing are internal to an organization
. The rate of customer penetration—the number of a retailer’s customers divided by the size of its target market —is external but influenced by all the internal factors mentioned above. Customer penetration rates play a crucial role in estimating product scale and so we deploy diffusion algorithms, such as bass diffusion, to estimate it.Bass diffusion models work on the premise that penetration rates differ for early adopters (or innovators) and late adopters (or imitators)
. These models estimate penetration rates across these two customer segments based on the behavior of similar SKUs, on-hand quantities, price points, and other considerations.To generate the final demand forecast for a new product, the estimated sales pattern is overlaid on the estimated rate of sales.The Human-Machine EcosystemAll effective demand forecasting frameworks are human-machine ecosystems—where software and people interact to synergistic effect—and this is certainly true for cold start modeling
. While the AI models provide an effective structure to generate forecasts, human domain knowledge and interpretative ability is necessary to create a highly accurate and explainable forecast. Put another way: It is essential to strike a balance between automated predictions and human expertise.ConclusionThe competitive nature of markets typically ensures survival of the fittest, and the ability to generate quality forecasts for new products is essential to retailers to maintain their edge in the race
. The rapid pace of fashion is here to stay and retailers should embrace this change through the adoption of AI and ML frameworks.Take the Next StepImpact Analytics ForecastSmart™ provides an excellent platform for demand forecasting in general and cold start modeling in particular

. Due to their need to constantly churn out new assortments, retailers often create products by modifying prior SKUs. Identifying these similar SKUs is the key to estimating how a new SKU will behave in the market. This is where AI steps in to provide accurate product similarity mapping
. AI-based clustering algorithms identify similarly behaving SKUs by considering factors such as product attribute data ( color, material, etc.), pricing information, launch dates, store penetration, life cycle information, and marketing data, then groups these SKUs into distinct clusters. Computer vision algorithms can also play a crucial role here by extracting product attributes directly from image data, making the process more accurate and faster
. These AI clustering algorithms create an accurate, well separated, optimum number of clusters containing similarly behaving SKUs. Sales patterns for a new SKU may now be effectively estimated from the behavior of SKUs in the cluster. Using Diffusion Algorithms to Estimate Rate of Sales A product’s rate of sales, or scale, depends on various factors such as buy quantity, price point, store penetration, marketing, and rate of customer penetration
. Buy quantity, pricing, store penetration, and marketing are internal to an organization. The rate of customer penetration—the number of a retailer’s customers divided by the size of its target market —is external but influenced by all the internal factors mentioned above. Customer penetration rates play a crucial role in estimating product scale and so we deploy diffusion algorithms, such as bass diffusion, to estimate it
. Bass diffusion models work on the premise that penetration rates differ for early adopters (or innovators) and late adopters (or imitators). These models estimate penetration rates across these two customer segments based on the behavior of similar SKUs, on-hand quantities, price points, and other considerations. To generate the final demand forecast for a new product, the estimated sales pattern is overlaid on the estimated rate of sales
. The Human-Machine Ecosystem All effective demand forecasting frameworks are human-machine ecosystems—where software and people interact to synergistic effect—and this is certainly true for cold start modeling. While the AI models provide an effective structure to generate forecasts, human domain knowledge and interpretative ability is necessary to create a highly accurate and explainable forecast. Put another way: It is essential to strike a balance between automated predictions and human expertise
. Conclusion The competitive nature of markets typically ensures survival of the fittest, and the ability to generate quality forecasts for new products is essential to retailers to maintain their edge in the race. The rapid pace of fashion is here to stay and retailers should embrace this change through the adoption of AI and ML frameworks.

Let’s crack the code on leveraging cutting-edge analytics, fostering collaborative intelligence, and integrating business plans to become more efficient and precise when addressing consumer demand
. How to Achieve Demand Forecasting Accuracy Accurate demand planning ensures the right balance between inventory levels and customer demand by analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and external factors to forecast future demand accurately.

. 1. Implement Integrated Business Planning (IBP) Integrated Business Planningconsiders the strategic, financial, and operational aspects of business planning to encourage a cohesive goal across all professional departments. This approach helps businesses anticipate market changes more effectively, align supply with demand, and meet business objectives more efficiently. According to a study by Gartner,55% of organizations rate IBPas highly valuable to overall supply chain value. 2
. 2. Leverage Advanced Analytics and AI Technologies The integration of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence has drastically improved demand planning. These technologies offer enhanced pattern recognition in historical data, improved forecast accuracy by considering multiple variables, and real-time data based on market trends. A report by McKinsey reveals thatAI-driven demand forecastingcan decrease lost sales by up to 65% and improve inventory accuracy. 3
. 3. Foster Collaborative Planning Collaborative planning brings together insights from sales, marketing, and customer service teams to create more comprehensive and accurate demand predictions. This approach broadens the forecast’s perspective and increases the reliability of predictions. By aligning internal stakeholders with demand expectations, businesses can make more informed strategic decisions. 4. Regularly Monitor and Evaluate Demand planning is not a set-and-forget process

Implementing a system for tracking market changes, customer insights, and supply chain fluctuations allows businesses to adapt quickly to shifts in demand patterns. Regular evaluation of demand forecasts and conducting post-mortem analyses on forecast accuracy minimize the risk of excess inventory and shortages. 5
. 5. Use Multiple Forecasting Methods Combining qualitative and quantitative forecasting techniques provides a comprehensive view of future customer demand. While quantitative methods analyze historical data and trends, qualitative techniques consider expert opinions and market research. Combiningboth of these approachesmitigates the limitations of each method, leading to more accurate forecasts. 6. Segment Demand for Precision Demand varies significantly across products, regions, and customer segments
. By segmenting demand, businesses can tailor forecasting approaches to specific contexts, understand unique drivers behind each segment, and improve accuracy for diverse product lines. This practice enables more effective resource allocation and optimized inventory management. 7. Leverage Machine Learning Algorithms Machine learning (ML) models can significantly enhance demand planning and forecasting accuracy by identifying complex patterns in historical data
. These insights empower companies to adapt to changing market conditions in real time, incorporating a wide range of variables into forecasts. 8. Incorporate External Data Sources Integrating external data sources into forecasting models can provide valuable context and improve accuracy. Consider incorporating economic indicators, weather data, social media trends, competitor pricing, and industry-specific indices
. This holistic approach to data analysis allows for more nuanced and accurate demand predictions. 9. Establish a Demand Forecasting Cadence Consistency is key indemand forecasting. Creating a regular cadence for updating demand planning and forecasting methods ensures that they remain relevant and reflect the latest market conditions. Depending on the industry and product lifecycle, this could be monthly, quarterly, or even weekly
. A consistent forecasting cadence allows you to stay agile and pivot to changes in demand as needed. 10. Integrate Risk Management Into Your Demand Planning Process Even with the best demand forecasting and planning strategies, future demand is inherently uncertain. Including risk management strategies in the forecasting process mitigates potential disruptions so you can at least be prepared during inevitable change
. Risk management involves: By incorporating risk management, you ensure more resilient supply chains that are capable of withstanding volatility and disruptions.

Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency Blockchain technologysecures supply chain visibility, which in turn improves demand forecasting by providing real-time tracking of goods throughout the supply chain. These features can improve data accuracy and reliability, facilitating better collaboration among supply chain partners

. Ice cream shops, for example, witness a surge in demand during scorching summers, followed by a significant dip in winter. By pinpointing these seasonal peaks and troughs, businesses establish pricing strategies that maximize revenue throughout the year
. Higher prices capitalize on heightened demand during peak seasons, while strategic discounts or promotions during off-seasons incentivize purchases and prevent inventory pileups.Inventory Levels:Demand-based pricing plays a crucial role inoptimizing inventorymanagement. Companies dealing with perishable goods or limited-edition items face the constant challenge of balancing supply with anticipated demand

. While often used interchangeably, they have distinct characteristics:Ademand planning modelis a specific method or tool used to forecast demand, such as statistical algorithms or collaborative techniques.Ademand planning frameworkis a broader system that outlines the overall process, including data collection, analysis, forecasting, and decision-making steps.Both models and frameworks aim to improve forecast accuracy, optimize inventory management, and align supply with market demand
. Let’s explore some key examples of each:1. Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR)Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CFPR) is a comprehensive business framework that merges the insights of various trading partners. These partners share information and coordinate their planning processes.Together, they synchronize demand forecasting, production, and supply chain planning. This framework highlights the importance of collaboration
. It’s especially valuable in complex supply chains where multiple stakeholders need to align their operations. Their goal is to effectively meet customer demand and minimize costs.2. Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization (MEIO)Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization (MEIO) is a model that looks at how different parts of the supply chain depend on each other
. This includes all steps from raw materials to the final products across various locations.MEIO helps companies balance inventory levels throughout their supply chain operations. It considers factors like holding costs, service levels, and stockout risks. This model is particularly useful for businesses with complex supply networks and varying demand across different products and areas.3
. Integrated Business Planning (IBP)Integrated Business Planning (IBP) is a framework that extends beyond traditional demand planning. It combines insights from the sales team, marketing, finance, and operations to create a unified planning process
. IBP aligns all business areas towards shared goals, with demand forecasting as a key component.This framework focuses on:Strategic alignment:Ensuring all departments work towards common objectives.Scenario planning:Preparing for various potential market conditions and future demand patterns.Financial integration:Merging financial projections with operational plans.IBP helps businesses make more informed decisions by providing a holistic view of the organization
. It enables companies to respond more effectively to market trends and optimize their resources across different functions.Demand Forecasting MethodsDemand forecasting methods can be broadly categorized into two main types: statistical methods and advanced methods
. While both aim to predict future demand, they differ in their approach and complexity.Statistical demand forecasting methods rely primarily on historical sales data and mathematical models, and are generally simpler to implement and interpret, making them suitable for stable markets with consistent demand patterns.Advanced methods incorporate more complex algorithms and often leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning
. Advanced methods can handle larger datasets, consider a wider range of variables, and are better suited for volatile markets or products with complex demand patterns.Both categories have their strengths and are often used in combination to create more robust forecasting models.Statistical demand forecasting methods include:Exponential Smoothing:A forecasting method for time series data. It gives more weight to recent data and less to older data
. This method works well for data that has a steady trend but no strong seasonality. It’s easy to use and adjustable for different data patterns. Variations include Exponential Smoothing for trends, Triple Exponential Smoothing, or the Holt-Winters method, which handles both trends and seasonality.Moving Averages:Calculates the average demand over chosen past periods.

FIFO vs. LIFO: Comparing Inventory Valuation Methods The way a business values its inventory plays a crucial role in shaping its financial statements, taxes, and profits. Two main methods are widely used: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out).How does a company choose the best method? What impact do these methods have on its financial health? This article breaks down LIFO and FIFO, showing how each affects a company’s bottom line
. Let’s explore these methods and understand their importance in the business world.Understanding FIFO and LIFO: A Detailed OverviewWhen managinginventory, selecting the correct valuation method is crucial. Two primary methods dominate this field:FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)
. These methods influence how you value your inventory, calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS), and, ultimately, how you manage financial statements, taxes, and profitability.FIFO Method: A Deeper DiveThe FIFO method is a straightforward concept. It assumes that the first items you add to your inventory are the first ones you sell. This method is often considered intuitive, especially for businesses dealing with perishable goods
. But there’s more to FIFO than just this basic principle.Inventory Flow and Financial ImpactFIFOaligns with the natural flow of goods, making it a logical choice for many businesses. When using FIFO, the cost of goods sold is based on the oldest inventory costs. This is particularly beneficial when prices are stable or falling
. In these situations, FIFO provides a more accurate reflection of current costs in your financial statements.For example, if you purchased 100 units at $10 each and then another 100 units at $12 each, FIFO would assign the $10 cost to the first 100 units sold. The remaining inventory items would be valued at $12 per unit, reflecting the more recent purchase price
. This results in a clear, up-to-date picture of inventory value on your balance sheet.Tax Implications and Profit ReportingHowever, FIFO can lead to higher tax liabilities. In an inflationary environment, where prices are rising, the cost of goods sold is lower under FIFO because you are using older, cheaper costs. This results in higher profits, which, while desirable in some respects, also lead to increased tax obligations
. For businesses, this means more of their profits go to taxes, potentially impactingcash flow and financial planning.FIFO is often the preferred method for companies that want to present a stronger financial position, as it typically results in higher reported profits. Investors might find this appealing, but it requires careful tax planning to avoid cash flow issues.Suitability for Different MarketsFIFO is particularly suited to businesses in stable or deflationary markets
. It ensures that theinventoryvaluation reflects the most recent costs, giving a clearer view of the financial state of the business. However, in rapidly rising markets, FIFO’s higher profits may lead to increased tax burdens.LIFO Inventory Valuation Method: A Closer LookLIFO, while less intuitive than FIFO, offers distinct advantages, particularly in inflationary environments. The LIFO method assumes that the last items added to your inventory are the first ones sold
. This approach can significantly impact your financial statements and tax obligations.Inventory Cost MatchingLIFO matches the cost of your most recent purchases with your current sales. This means that during times of rising prices, LIFO results in higher costs of goods sold. For example, using the same purchase scenario as before, LIFO would assign the $12 cost to the first 100 units sold
. The older inventory, purchased at $10, remains in stock, potentially distorting its value on the balance sheet.This method can be advantageous in inflationary times because it aligns current revenue with current costs. It presents a more accurate picture of the actual cost of goods sold, helping businesses manage profits and taxes more effectively.Tax Savings and Financial FlexibilityOne of the most significant advantages of LIFO is its ability to reduce taxable net income
. By reporting higher costs of goods sold, LIFO lowers your profits, which, in turn, reduces your tax obligations. This can result in substantial tax savings, improving cash flow and offering more financial flexibility.However, this benefit comes with some challenges. Lower reported profits might not be appealing to investors or stakeholders who are more interested in a company’s profitability. Additionally, the complexity of LIFO requires meticulous record-keeping to track inventory layers accurately
. This can increase administrative costs and the likelihood of errors.Strategic Use of LIFO Inventory MethodsDespite these challenges, LIFO can be a strategic choice for businesses aiming to minimize tax liabilities. By lowering reported profits, companies using LIFO may find it easier to manage cash flow and reinvest in growth opportunities
. This approach can be particularly beneficial for businesses with non-perishable inventory, where the risk of obsolescence is lower.Choosing Between FIFO and LIFO Inventory ValuationSelecting betweenFIFO and LIFOdepends on your business’s unique circumstances
. Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these is key to making an informed decision.Factors to ConsiderMarket Conditions:FIFO is generally better suited to stable or deflationary markets, while LIFO is more beneficial in inflationary environments.Industry Type:FIFO works well for businesses dealing with perishable goods, ensuring that older inventory is sold first
. LIFO is often better for companies with non-perishable items, where inventory costs can be managed more strategically.Tax Implications:FIFO may result in higher taxes due to higher reported profits, which could impact cash flow. LIFO, on the other hand, offers tax savings by reducing taxable income, though it might result in lower reported profits.Financial Reporting:FIFO provides a more accurate reflection of inventory value on the balance sheet, aligning with recent costs
. LIFO, however, can distort the value of remaining inventory, particularly in inflationary times.Long-Term ConsiderationsIt’s also essential to consider the long-term implications of your choice. FIFO is generally simpler to manage and complies with both GAAP and IFRS, making it a safer choice for international businesses
. LIFO, while not accepted under IFRS, can be advantageous for U.S.-based companies looking to optimize their tax strategy during periods of inflation.The decision between FIFO and LIFO is not just about immediate financial benefits. It’s about aligning yourinventory valuation methodwith your overall business strategy, market conditions, and long-term goals.FIFO vs. LIFO: Advantages and DisadvantagesFIFO and LIFO are two ways to value your products. FIFO means selling the oldest items first
. FIFO means selling the oldest items first. LIFO means selling the newest items first. Each method has upsides and downsides.FIFO often shows higher profits but can lead to higher taxes. LIFO can lower your taxes but might show lower profits. It’s more complex to track. Let’s look closer at each method’s pros and cons.FIFO Method AdvantagesMatches Natural Flow:FIFO matches the natural flow of inventory. The oldest items are sold first
. The oldest items are sold first. This is great for businesses with perishable goods.Current Cost Representation:FIFO shows the cost of the latest inventory. This helps in keeping the balance sheet updated with current prices.Higher Profit Margins:FIFO often results in higher profit margins in stable or falling markets. It uses older, cheaper costs for COGS, which can boost profits.Easy to Manage:FIFO is simple to manage
. It avoids complex tracking of inventory layers, making record-keeping straightforward.Clear Financial Picture:FIFO provides a clear view of inventory value. This clarity helps in preparing transparent financial statements for investors.FIFO Method DisadvantagesHigher Taxes During Inflation:FIFO can lead to higher taxes in an inflationary environment
. It uses older, lower costs for COGS, which increases reported profits and taxes.Potential Overvaluation:FIFO might overstate the value of ending inventory during price increases. If prices drop, the inventory value may not match the market value.Higher Tax Burden:Higher reported profits under FIFO mean more taxes. Businesses need to plan for this increased tax expense.Cost Matching Issues:FIFO may not align costs with revenues well during price changes
. This can affect how financial performance is reflected.LIFO Method AdvantagesReduces Taxable Income:LIFO helps lower taxable income during inflation. It matches recent, higher costs with current sales, resulting in lower reported profits and taxes.Better Cost Matching:LIFO matches recent costs with sales. This provides a more accurate picture of the cost of goods sold during inflation.Improves Cash Flow:LIFO can improve cash flow by reducing taxes
. This offers more flexibility for reinvestment or other financial needs.Strategic Financial Management:LIFO helps manage profits and taxes strategically. It is useful in industries with fluctuating prices.LIFO Method DisadvantagesComplex Tracking:LIFO requires careful tracking of inventory layers. This can increase administrative costs and the risk of errors.Distorted Inventory Value:LIFO can distort inventory values on the balance sheet
. Older inventory might not reflect current market conditions accurately.Investor Disinterest:Lower reported profits under LIFO might deter investors. Investors often prefer higher profitability, which LIFO may not show.International Issues:LIFO is not allowed under IFRS. This can be a problem for businesses operating globally. They might need to switch to FIFO or another method for international compliance.Obsolescence Risks:With LIFO, older inventory might become obsolete
. This can lead to outdated inventory values and extra management efforts.Examples of LIFO and FIFOExample 1: Grocery StoreA grocery store stocks perishable items like milk. The store receives shipments of milk on January 1st at $2 per gallon and on January 10th at $2.50 per gallon. Under FIFO, if the store sells milk on January 12th, it will record the cost of the milk sold at $2 per gallon, assuming it sells the oldest stock first
. The remaining inventory is valued at $2.50 per gallon.Example 2: Furniture RetailerA furniture retailer receives a shipment of chairs in March at $50 per chair and another shipment in April at $60 per chair. Under FIFO, if the retailer sells a chair in May, it will record the cost at $50, reflecting the older inventory. The remaining inventory will be valued at $60 per chair.Example 3: Toy StoreA toy store receives a batch of action figures in June at $10 each and another batch in July at $12 each
. Under LIFO, if the store sells action figures in August, it will record the cost at $12 per figure, assuming the latest stock is sold first. The remaining inventory will be valued at $10 per figure.Example 4: Car DealershipA car dealership receives a shipment of sedans in September at $20,000 each and another shipment in October at $22,000 each. Under LIFO, if a sedan is sold in November, it will be recorded at $22,000, representing the cost of the most recent inventory
. The remaining sedans will be valued at $20,000 each.Example 5: Clothing RetailerExample 5: Clothing RetailerA clothing retailer operates in a market where fabric costs are rising. Under FIFO, the retailer sells older, cheaper inventory first, resulting in lower COGS and higher reported profits
. Under LIFO, selling the more recent, expensive inventory first results in higher COGS and lower reported profits.Impact on Financial StatementsThe choice between FIFO and LIFO can significantly impact a company’s financial statements. During periods of rising prices, FIFO typically results in lower COGS and higher profits, as older, cheaper inventory is sold first
. Conversely, LIFO often leads to higher COGS and lower profits since newer, more expensive inventory is sold first.ConclusionIn conclusion, FIFO and LIFO are two ways to value inventory. FIFO sells the oldest items first. It gives a clear view of costs. LIFO sells the newest items first. It matches current costs with sales. Which method is best for you depends on your business goals. FIFO is easy to manage and provides clear statements

Mastering Inventory Formulas in 2025 Effective inventory control ensures that you have the right products in the right quantities at the right time
. This prevents stockouts, reduces carrying costs, and improves customer satisfaction.Ever wondered how you could minimize costs while maximizing stock availability? Or how to calculate the exact reorder point to avoid stockouts without overstocking? These are the challenges every business faces, and the following inventory formulas provide the answers.Whether you’re new toinventory managementor looking to refine your strategies, mastering these formulas will empower you to make informed decisions and
will empower you to make informed decisions and achieve operational excellence
. Let’s get started!1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a crucial concept in inventory management. It identifies the optimal number of units to order, minimizing the combined costs of ordering and holding inventory. Ensure that inventory levels are sufficient to meet demand without incurring excessive storage costs or frequent ordering expenses.This method helps maintain an inventory balance, reducing waste and avoiding stockouts
. Implementing EOQ leads to more efficient inventory control, better cash flow management, and overall cost savings. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your EOQ can adapt to changing demand and market conditions, keeping your operations running smoothly.EOQ=√(2(DXS)/H)D: Demand in units (annual)S: Ordering cost per orderH: Holding cost per unit (annual)Example: Suppose you have an annual demand of 10,000 units, an ordering cost or cost of inventory is $50 per order, and a holding cost of $2 per unit per year
. Your EOQ would be:√(2×10,000×50)/2=√(1,000,000/2)=√500,000=707 unitsYou should order 707 units each time to minimize total costs.2. Reorder Point (ROP)The Reorder Point (ROP) in inventory management is a critical threshold that indicates when it’s time to replenish stock to prevent running out of inventory, known as a stockout. It takes into account two primary factors: lead time and average demand
. Lead time refers to the duration between placing an order and receiving the stock, which can vary based on supplier capabilities, shipping times, and other logistical factors. Average demand represents the typical rate at which inventory is consumed or sold over a given day in the period.By calculating and monitoring the Reorder Point, businesses can ensure they have enough inventory on hand to meet ongoing customer demands without interruptions
. Falling below the Reorder Point could lead to delays in fulfilling orders, potentially disappointing customers and harming the business’s reputation for reliability. Here’s how you can calculate:ROP =d X Ld: Average demand per periodL: Lead time in periodsExample: If your average daily demand is 50 units and your supplier’s lead time is 10 days, your50 X 10 = 500 unitsWhen your inventory drops to 500 units, it’s time to reorder.3
. Safety StockSafety stock is a fundamental component of effective inventory management, acting as a protective buffer against unpredictability in both customer demand and supplier reliability. Its primary purpose is to provide a cushion of additional inventory beyond what is expected to be needed based on regular sales forecasts
. This extra stock serves as insurance against sudden spikes in demand, unexpected delays in supply chains, or other unforeseen disruptions that could otherwise lead to stockouts.By maintaining safety stock, businesses can significantly reduce the risk of not being able to fulfill customer orders promptly. This proactive approach not only enhances customer satisfaction by ensuring products are available when needed but also preserves the company’s reputation for reliability
. Imagine a scenario where a sudden surge in customer demand occurs due to a seasonal event or a marketing campaign. Without safety stock, businesses might struggle to replenish inventory quickly enough, potentially losing sales opportunities and customer loyalty
. Here’s how you can calculate:Safety Stock =Z X Standard deviation of demand X √LZ: Service level factor (number of standard deviations corresponding to desired service level)L: Lead timeExample: Suppose you want a 95% service level, which corresponds to a Z-value of 1.65. If your demand’s standard deviation is 20 units, and your lead time is 10 days, your safety stock would be:1.65 X 20 X √10 = 1.65 X 20 X 3.16 = 104.28 unitsKeep 104 units as safety stock to maintain a 95% service level.4
. High Inventory Turnover RatioThe Inventory Turnover Ratio reveals how frequently you sell and replenish your inventory within a specific period. A higher ratio signifies effective inventory management, indicating strong sales and efficient stock control

inventory system?A perpetual inventory system provides real-time tracking of inventory levels, improving accuracy and helping you make informed decisions
. Effective inventory control ensures that you have the right products in the right quantities at the right time. This prevents stockouts, reduces carrying costs, and improves customer satisfaction. Ever wondered how you could minimize costs while maximizing stock availability? Or how to calculate the exact reorder point to avoid stockouts without overstocking? These are the challenges every business faces, and the following inventory formulas provide the answers
. Whether you’re new toinventory managementor looking to refine your strategies, mastering these formulas will empower you to make informed decisions and achieve operational excellence. Let’s get started! 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a crucial concept in inventory management. It identifies the optimal number of units to order, minimizing the combined costs of ordering and holding inventory
. Ensure that inventory levels are sufficient to meet demand without incurring excessive storage costs or frequent ordering expenses. This method helps maintain an inventory balance, reducing waste and avoiding stockouts. Implementing EOQ leads to more efficient inventory control, better cash flow management, and overall cost savings. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your EOQ can adapt to changing demand and market conditions, keeping your operations running smoothly
. EOQ=√(2(DXS)/H) Example: Suppose you have an annual demand of 10,000 units, an ordering cost or cost of inventory is $50 per order, and a holding cost of $2 per unit per year. Your EOQ would be: √(2×10,000×50)/2=√(1,000,000/2)=√500,000=707 units You should order 707 units each time to minimize total costs. 2. Reorder Point (ROP) The Reorder Point (ROP) in inventory management is a critical threshold that indicates when it’s time to replenish stock to prevent running out of inventory, known as a stockout
. It takes into account two primary factors: lead time and average demand. Lead time refers to the duration between placing an order and receiving the stock, which can vary based on supplier capabilities, shipping times, and other logistical factors. Average demand represents the typical rate at which inventory is consumed or sold over a given day in the period
. By calculating and monitoring the Reorder Point, businesses can ensure they have enough inventory on hand to meet ongoing customer demands without interruptions. Falling below the Reorder Point could lead to delays in fulfilling orders, potentially disappointing customers and harming the business’s reputation for reliability
. Here’s how you can calculate: ROP =d X L Example: If your average daily demand is 50 units and your supplier’s lead time is 10 days, your 50 X 10 = 500 units When your inventory drops to 500 units, it’s time to reorder. 3. Safety Stock Safety stock is a fundamental component of effective inventory management, acting as a protective buffer against unpredictability in both customer demand and supplier reliability
. Its primary purpose is to provide a cushion of additional inventory beyond what is expected to be needed based on regular sales forecasts. This extra stock serves as insurance against sudden spikes in demand, unexpected delays in supply chains, or other unforeseen disruptions that could otherwise lead to stockouts. By maintaining safety stock, businesses can significantly reduce the risk of not being able to fulfill customer orders promptly
. This proactive approach not only enhances customer satisfaction by ensuring products are available when needed but also preserves the company’s reputation for reliability. Imagine a scenario where a sudden surge in customer demand occurs due to a seasonal event or a marketing campaign. Without safety stock, businesses might struggle to replenish inventory quickly enough, potentially losing sales opportunities and customer loyalty
. Here’s how you can calculate: Safety Stock =Z X Standard deviation of demand X √L Example: Suppose you want a 95% service level, which corresponds to a Z-value of 1.65. If your demand’s standard deviation is 20 units, and your lead time is 10 days, your safety stock would be: 1.65 X 20 X √10 = 1.65 X 20 X 3.16 = 104.28 units Keep 104 units as safety stock to maintain a 95% service level. 4
. 4. High Inventory Turnover Ratio The Inventory Turnover Ratio reveals how frequently you sell and replenish your inventory within a specific period. A higher ratio signifies effective inventory management, indicating strong sales and efficient stock control

Different methods yield different results. Let’s explore how these methods work in practice.1
. First-In, First-Out (FIFO) ExampleSuppose you purchase 100 units at $10 each and later buy another 100 units at $15 each. You sell 150 units. Under FIFO, the first 100 units sold are valued at $10 each. The next 50 units are valued at $15 each. Your COGS is (100 * $10) + (50 * $15) = $1000 + $750 = $1750. The remaining inventory is valued at $15 each. FIFO reflects recent costs in your inventory value. It results in higher inventory values during inflation.2
. Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) ExampleUsing the same purchases, LIFO assumes you sold the last 100 units purchased first. So, the first 100 units sold are valued at $15 each. The next 50 units are valued at $10 each. Your COGS is (100 * $15) + (50 * $10) = $1500 + $500 = $2000. The remaining inventory is valued at $10 each. LIFO can reduce taxable income during inflation by increasing COGS.3
. Weighted Average Cost ExampleWith the same purchases, the total cost is (100 * $10) + (100 * $15) = $1000 + $1500 = $2500. The total units are 200. The average cost per unit is $2500 / 200 = $12.50. If you sell 150 units, COGS is 150 * $12.50 = $1875. The remaining inventory is valued at $12.50 per unit. This method smooths out price fluctuations.4. Specific Identification ExampleThis method tracks the cost of each specific item. Suppose you sell a unique item that you purchased for $1000
. Your COGS is exactly $1000. The remaining inventory consists of items with known purchase costs. This method is highly accurate but requires detailed records.5. Retail Inventory Method ExampleIf the total retail price of your inventory is $10,000 and the gross margin is 40%, the cost is estimated at $6000. If you sold half of the inventory, the COGS is $3000. The remaining inventory is valued at $3000
. The remaining inventory is valued at $3000. This method provides a quick estimate based on retail prices and margins.Choosing the Best Inventory Valuation MethodChoosing the rightinventory valuationmethod is crucial for accurate financial reporting and effective decision-making. Here’s a simple guide to help you choose the best method for your business.1. Understand the MethodsThere are three main inventory valuation methods:First-In, First-Out (FIFO): Assumes the first items purchased are the first sold
. Useful when prices are rising as it lowers the cost of goods sold and shows higher profits.Last-In, First-Out (LIFO): Assumes the last items purchased are the first sold. This method is beneficial in times of rising prices because it results in a higher cost of goods sold and lower taxable income.Weighted Average Cost: Calculates the average cost of all items in inventory. This method smooths out price fluctuations and is simpler to apply.2
. Consider Your IndustryRetailers: FIFO is often preferred because it matches the actual flow of goods and reflects current market prices.Manufacturers: LIFO might be more suitable due to the nature of inventory turnover and rising material costs.Businesses with Perishable Goods: FIFO is ideal for perishable items to ensure older inventory is sold first.3
. Evaluate Your Financial GoalsProfit Margins: FIFO can result in higher reported profits in times of inflation, while LIFO might show lower profits but offer tax advantages.Cash Flow: Consider how each method affects your cash flow and taxes. FIFO may show higher profits but also lead to higher taxes. LIFO could reduce taxable income but might not reflect current inventory values accurately.4. Check Regulatory RequirementsSome accounting standards and tax regulations mandate or restrict certain methods
. Ensure you comply with the rules applicable in your country or industry.5. Analyze Your Inventory TurnoverHigh Turnover: FIFO can be effective if you frequently restock and sell inventory.Low Turnover: Weighted Average Cost might be more appropriate if your inventory sits for longer periods.6. Assess Simplicity and ConsistencyChoose a method that aligns with your accounting resources and capabilities
. The method should be easy to maintain and consistent with your business practices.ConclusionInventory valuation is vital for your financial success.

Make-to-Order vs. Make-to-Stock Planning: Choosing the Right Fit Choosing the right production strategy is crucial for your business’s success. Two of the most popular methods are Make-to-Order (MTO) and Make-to-Stock (MTS). But which one is right for you?Many businesses today use a hybrid approach, blending MTO and MTS to meet their specific needs. Whether you’re starting with MTO and considering MTS, or vice versa, understanding how each process works is essential for making informed decisions
. Read on to discover which strategy best fits your business requirements.What is Make to Order?Make-to-Order (MTO) is aproduction strategy. It means that items are made only after a customer places an order. This is very different from traditional retail models. Normally, products are produced in advance and stored until sold. But with MTO, nothing is created until there’s confirmed demand
. Each item is made specifically to meet the customer’s request.MTO is also known as the “Pull Method.” This means the customer’s order pulls the item into production. The product doesn’t exist until the customer requests it. It’s a production system driven by real demand. This is the opposite of the “Push Method.” In that method, businesses produce products in bulk and store them, hoping they will sell.MTO can be seen with products like customized apparel or personalized gifts
. For example, a customer may order a specific size, color, or design that isn’t available in-store. The product is then made based on their unique choices. The item doesn’t exist until the customer places their order.This type of production allows for high customization. Each item is tailored to fit the customer’s needs. Think about online stores that offer custom t-shirts, personalized accessories, or made-to-measure clothing
. These businesses only produce the item after the customer makes their selection.With MTO, the process may take longer than simply buying from stock. However, the customer gets exactly what they want. This method allows retailers to offer unique products. It also helps manage inventory better, as nothing is made without demand.MTO requires good coordination between teams. Sales, production, and suppliers need to work closely to meet customer expectations. Any miscommunication can delay the process
. Any miscommunication can delay the process. But when done well, MTO ensures that each product is made to meet the customer’s exact needs.MTO is becoming more popular as customers want personalized experiences. People want items that feel unique to them. Retailers using MTO can offer this, helping them stand out in the market.Advantages of Make-to-Order ManufacturingCustomizationWith MTO, retailers can offer personalized products. Every item is made to fit the customer’s exact needs
. This gives shoppers a unique experience. They feel like the product was made just for them.Less Inventory WasteSince products are made only after an order is placed, there’s no need to store unsold stock. This reduces the risk of unsold inventory piling up. Retailers only produce what is needed, lowering waste and storage costs.Better Cash FlowMake-to-Order planning helps manage cash flow more effectively. Retailers don’t need to spend money producing large quantities of stock upfront
. Instead, they can focus on creating items when demand is there. This means less capital is tied up in inventory.Reduced OverproductionIn traditional models, overproduction can lead to excess stock. MTO prevents this. Every product made has a customer waiting for it. This reduces the chance of unsold items taking up space.Higher Customer SatisfactionCustomers appreciate receiving products tailored to their preferences. MTO gives them exactly what they want
. MTO gives them exactly what they want. This can lead to higher satisfaction and increased loyalty.Disadvantages of Make-to-Order ManufacturingLonger Delivery TimesOne of the main downsides is the waiting period. Since products aren’t pre-made, customers have to wait longer for delivery. This may cause frustration, especially if they expect quick turnarounds.Complex Supply ChainMTO requires careful coordination between teams. Production, sales, and suppliers must work together smoothly
. Any delay in thesupply chaincan disrupt the process, leading to longer delivery times or missed deadlines.Higher Production CostsProducing items one by one can be more expensive than mass production. Retailers may face higher costs per unit. This could lead to higher prices for the customer or lower profit margins for the business.Uncertain DemandIn some cases, the demand might fluctuate unexpectedly. If the demand suddenly increases, it may be hard for retailers to keep up with orders
. This could lead to delays or lost sales if they can’t meet demand quickly enough.Limited ScalabilityMTO can be challenging to scale. When demand grows, it becomes harder to keep up with orders in a timely manner. For small businesses, it can work well. But for larger retailers, scaling the MTO model may require significant investment in resources and technology.What is Make-to-Stock (MTS)?Make-to-Stock (MTS) is a production strategy where products are manufactured in advance and ready to be sold
. This method is common in retail and manufacturing processes. It focuses onpredicting customer demand, producing goods based on thoseforecasts, and storing them until needed.Products are made in bulk before any customer places an order. Retailers estimate how much of each product will be sold. Based on that, they decide how many units to produce
. This makes MTS ideal for businesses with high-volume products that sell regularly, such as clothing, electronics, or household items.The products sit ininventoryuntil someone buys them. So, having the right amount is crucial. If theforecast is accurate, retailers can meet customer demand without any delays. But if the forecast is wrong, it can lead to overstock or stockouts. Overstock means there are too many products sitting in the warehouse, taking up space and tying up cash
. Stockouts mean there aren’t enough products available, leading to lost sales.MTS method allows businesses to serve customers faster. Since products are already made and in stock, they can be shipped or sold immediately when ordered. However, this method relies heavily on accuratedemand forecasting. Predicting customer behavior is not always easy. If demand suddenly drops, retailers may be stuck with excess inventory
. If demand spikes, they may not have enough stock to fulfill orders.Advantages of Make-to-Stock ProductionFaster Order FulfillmentProducts are made and ready before customers order. This speeds up delivery times. Customers get their items quickly, improving satisfaction.Predictable ProductionYou can plan production schedules ahead of time. This helps manage resources better. Consistent output keeps operations smooth.Stable SupplyAlways have products on hand for customers
. Reduces the risk of running out of stock. Ensures that you can meet customer demand consistently.Bulk PurchasingBuying raw materials in large quantities often saves money. Lower material costs can boost profit margins. This bulk buying can be economically beneficial.Disadvantages of Make-to-Stock PlanningForecasting ChallengesAccuratedemand forecastingis crucial but difficult. Errors can lead to excess stock or shortages
. Errors can lead to excess stock or shortages. Inaccurate forecasts can disrupt operations and financial planning.Seasonal RiskStockpiling for seasonal demand can backfire. If trends shift, you may end up with unsold goods. This can lead to financial losses and excess inventory.Storage LimitationsRequires substantial storage space, which may be costly. Limited space can restrict how much inventory you can hold
. Managing large volumes can become a logistical challenge.Obsolescence RiskRapid changes in technology or fashion can render products outdated. Holding onto obsolete stock can be costly. It may also impact your brand’s market relevance.Complex Inventory ManagementBalancing stock levels and maintaining accuracy can be complex. Overseeing large inventories increases the risk of errors. It demands robust systems and processes to manage effectively.Make-to-Order vs
. Make-to-Stock: A Quick SynopsisThe larger the order quantity of an item, the more efficient the production—it’s simple logic. However, not all products have consistent demand. To avoid overstocking, Make-to-Order becomes an option. As discussed earlier, each method has its pros and cons, so the choice between them requires careful consideration
. It depends on several factors.Make to OrderMake to StockLead TimeLonger, as production starts after an order is placed.Shorter, as products are pre-made and available.Inventory ExpensesLower, as there is little to no finished goods inventory.Higher, as large amounts of stock are held in warehouses.Product VarietyHigh, as products can be tailored to individual customer needs.Limited, as only standard products are produced in bulk.Capacity UtilizationCan be low during periods of low demand, as production

Make-to-Stock (MTS) is a production strategy where products are manufactured in advance and ready to be sold. This method is common in retail and manufacturing processes. It focuses onpredicting customer demand, producing goods based on thoseforecasts, and storing them until needed
. Products are made in bulk before any customer places an order. Retailers estimate how much of each product will be sold. Based on that, they decide how many units to produce. This makes MTS ideal for businesses with high-volume products that sell regularly, such as clothing, electronics, or household items. The products sit ininventoryuntil someone buys them. So, having the right amount is crucial. If theforecast is accurate, retailers can meet customer demand without any delays
. But if the forecast is wrong, it can lead to overstock or stockouts. Overstock means there are too many products sitting in the warehouse, taking up space and tying up cash. Stockouts mean there aren’t enough products available, leading to lost sales. MTS method allows businesses to serve customers faster. Since products are already made and in stock, they can be shipped or sold immediately when ordered. However, this method relies heavily on accuratedemand forecasting
. Predicting customer behavior is not always easy. If demand suddenly drops, retailers may be stuck with excess inventory. If demand spikes, they may not have enough stock to fulfill orders. Advantages of Make-to-Stock Production Faster Order Fulfillment Products are made and ready before customers order. This speeds up delivery times. Customers get their items quickly, improving satisfaction. Predictable Production You can plan production schedules ahead of time. This helps manage resources better
. This helps manage resources better. Consistent output keeps operations smooth. Stable Supply Always have products on hand for customers. Reduces the risk of running out of stock. Ensures that you can meet customer demand consistently. Bulk Purchasing Buying raw materials in large quantities often saves money. Lower material costs can boost profit margins. This bulk buying can be economically beneficial
. This bulk buying can be economically beneficial. Disadvantages of Make-to-Stock Planning Forecasting Challenges Accuratedemand forecastingis crucial but difficult. Errors can lead to excess stock or shortages. Inaccurate forecasts can disrupt operations and financial planning. Seasonal Risk Stockpiling for seasonal demand can backfire. If trends shift, you may end up with unsold goods. This can lead to financial losses and excess inventory
. Storage Limitations Requires substantial storage space, which may be costly. Limited space can restrict how much inventory you can hold. Managing large volumes can become a logistical challenge. Obsolescence Risk Rapid changes in technology or fashion can render products outdated. Holding onto obsolete stock can be costly. It may also impact your brand’s market relevance. Complex Inventory Management Balancing stock levels and maintaining accuracy can be complex
. Overseeing large inventories increases the risk of errors. It demands robust systems and processes to manage effectively. Make-to-Order vs. Make-to-Stock: A Quick Synopsis The larger the order quantity of an item, the more efficient the production—it’s simple logic. However, not all products have consistent demand. To avoid overstocking, Make-to-Order becomes an option. As discussed earlier, each method has its pros and cons, so the choice between them requires careful consideration
. It depends on several factors. Make to Order Make to Stock Conclusion The decision between Make-to-Order vs. Make-to-Stock hinges on your business model. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Assess your demand, product type, and cost structure before choosing a strategy. Whether you opt for MTO or MTS, aligning your production with customer needs is key to success. Take the Next Step Transform your inventory and supply chain. Make your operations leaner, more responsive, and profitable
. Check outImpact Analytics InventorySmart™to enhance your supply chain operations. Frequently Asked Questions How can MTO and MTS be combined for a hybrid approach? A hybrid approach can involve maintaining a base stock of standard products while offering customization options. This allows for shorter lead times for standard products while accommodating customer preferences
. What are the implications of MTO and MTS on supply chain sustainability? MTO can reduce waste by producing only what is needed, while MTS may increase waste due to excess inventory. Both strategies can impact carbon emissions and ethical sourcing depending on factors like transportation, material sourcing, and energy consumption. How can MTO and MTS be used to support circular economy principles? MTO can reduce waste by producing only what is needed, while MTS may increase waste due to excess inventory
. Both strategies can contribute to a circular economy by using recycled materials, extending product lifecycles, and reducing waste. Resources Equip yourself with more information on the latest trends in the market, technology, and how your peers are solving their business problems

. A Discontinued Perennial is a Perennial or Seasonal Perennial item that has been dropped from the assortment and needs to be liquidated. Almost any Perennial or Seasonal Perennial item could become a Discontinued Perennial as it approaches the end of its customer appeal. Think of a fashion color of a basic tee shirt. Inventory levels for Discontinued Perennials should decrease until they approach zero prior to liquidation
. Markdown Optimization Seasonality Type: Seasonal/Short Lifecycle (SSL) SSL inventory levels should be managed using this markdown optimization process, as well as through changes to promotional plans, and through manipulation or cancellation of any reorder amounts. SSL items are items that sell only for a specific season or time. Think of a heavy winter coat or pair of novelty shorts. SSL sales are heavily influenced by weather patterns or events such as Christmas
. SSL inventory levels should decrease until they approach zero prior to liquidation. Markdown Optimization Seasonality Type: New Items Inventory levels for New items should be managed using this markdown optimization process, as well as through changes to promotional plans, and through manipulation or cancellation of any reorder amounts
. New items, whether intended for short lifecycles or expected to mature into Perennial items, should be treated in the same way as SSL items—as if they were going to be terminated at the end of the season unless their in-season performance warrants a transition to a different Seasonality Type

Markdown Optimization Part 2: How to Succeed if You’re Not Using Pricing Software Josh PollackVP, Implementation and Business DevelopmentWelcome to this blog for determining liquidation percentage, the second installment in my three-part series outlining the markdown optimization process for retailers using manual methods. I understand some retailers don’t have the wherewithal to invest inadvanced pricing analytics software
. Still, I highly encourage you to exploreImpact Analytics PriceSmart™.InPart 1, I covered the basics of this markdown process by looking at inventory through a “Seasonality” lens. If you haven’t read it already, you should start at Part 1 as the main concepts I introduced are carried through to this piece.Just a reminder: The markdown process outlined below is meant for retailers with significant amounts of short-lifecycle or discontinued products
. You should not use this markdown process for recurring basic and core items; rather, you should manage inventory for these items by manipulating future orders and changing planned promotions.Ready? Let’s go!Markdown Optimization: Liquidation PercentageAs I described inPart 1, this markdown management approach is based on the seasonality characteristics of products. You first identify an item’s week of peak demand and then select a week shortly after to begin marking it down
. This markdown kickoff date is determined by the target Liquidation Percentage you’ve set for that item.Liquidation Percentage is a metric representing the percentage of units sold out of the total units available
. It is calculated slightly differently in preseason (planned) than midseason (actual).Liquidation Percentage Calculation: Preseason or PlannedPrior to the season, you’ll calculate Planned Liquidation Percentage based on the Cumulative Planned Sales Units (season-to-date unit sales) for the relevant week (Week X) as shown below.Determine the target Liquidation Percentage at the initial markdown date during assortment planning using a company benchmark, typically 75-85 percent
. Then peg the initial markdown date to the week in which you expect the item to reach the Planned Liquidation Percentage.Example: The Knit Tops buyer acquires 6,000 units of a basic tee shirt in a new seasonal pattern that you targeted to sell in the Spring/Easter timeframe
. The Planned Liquidation Percentage for this item is 75 percent on its initial markdown date, meaning you plan to sell 25 percent of these units during the markdown period.Using the above benchmark, here’s how to determine the week in which this Planned Liquidation Percentage is attained. We see the Planned Cumulative Unit Sales for Week 18 are 4,574. The Planned Season On Order Units are 6,000
. The Planned Season On Order Units are 6,000. Since it is a new item, the Season Beginning Inventory Units is zero.This style will reach the 75 percent Planned Liquidation Percentage in week 18 of the season.You establish Week 18, then, as the initial markdown date for this style.If the print tee style in the example above sells according to plan, you begin marking it down in week 18. If the item is outperforming the plan, delay the markdown process accordingly
. If the item is underperforming to plan, start the markdown process sooner.Base your liquidation date—the effective end date for the markdown process—on company policy or on contracts in place with third-party providers. This may represent the date that products are marked out-of-stock, transferred to a liquidator, shunted to an outlet store, or whatever final disposition strategy you execute
. The markdown period is the time between the initial markdown date and the liquidation date.Liquidation Percentage Calculation: Midseason or ActualDuring the season, as selling weeks elapse, calculate Actual Liquidation Percentage as below.Values for all these variables should be gathered during the week being analyzed.Example: The same patterned tee shirt has been selling for 16 weeks. Now the Buyer wants to evaluate if the initial markdown should still take place in week 18
. To do this, calculate the Actual Liquidation Percentage for week 17 and compare it to the Planned Liquidation Percentage for that week.In this example, the Actual Cumulative Unit Sales for Week 17 are 4,189 (slightly below the Planned Cumulative Unit Sales). The Inventory Units On Hand are 1,811. The Inventory Units On Order are zero since all deliveries have been received by this date.This style’s Planned Liquidation Percentage for week 17 is 69.9%
. The Actual Liquidation Percentage for that week is 69.8%
. The style is performing quite close to the plan and should be marked down on schedule.Markdown Optimization Process: To Be Continued!This is Part 2 in a three-part series of blogs outlining a strong markdown optimization process for use by retailers who, for whatever reason, are not usingadvanced pricing analytics software.Part 1covers the markdown optimization process basics.Part 3 will cover how to determine the markdown cadence.Stay tuned!Take the Next StepI’d be selling you short if I didn’t encourage

. Still, I highly encourage you to exploreImpact Analytics PriceSmart™.Markdown Optimization Process: Standard Markdown CadenceRetailers should develop standard markdown cadences for particular items or categories based on data analysis and their experience with past clearance activities
. Virtually all markdown cadences should include at least three price movements prior to arriving at the final liquidation.A good, minimal target for the initial markdown percentage is 25 percent—it’s deep enough of a discount to grab customers’ attention and encourage them to purchase but doesn’t give away excessive margin.Of course, be sure to follow your company’s price-ending business rules
. The resulting discount rates may vary from the targets outlined here.The following examples use a standard markdown progression common in apparel.An item selling according to plan should begin its markdown cadence with a 25 percent discount at the initial markdown date. Keep the item at the new markdown price for three weeks.When the third week elapses, take the second markdown of 40 percent off the regular retail price
. Again, keep the new markdown price for three weeks.After this initial six-week clearance period, mark down the item to 60 percent off the regular retail price
. Stay the course for another three weeks.If any items are still available, you should knock off 70 percent from the regular retail price until it reaches its liquidation date.Markdown Optimization Process: Deferred Markdown CadenceFeel free to delay the markdown cadence for items tracking ahead of their initial markdown date’s targetLiquidation Percentage; say, you’ve liquidated 90 percent of total units available instead of the anticipated 75 percent
. In such cases, you may initiate a markdown cadence resembling the following example.Don’t change prices for the first five weeks of the planned Clearance Period.At the sixth week, mark it down 40 percent off the regular retail price and keep it at this initial markdown price for three weeks
. Then mark it down to 60 percent off the regular retail price and keep it there it reaches its liquidation date.Markdown Optimization Process: Accelerated Markdown CadenceConversely, for styles tracking behind their preclearance target liquidation percentage—say, you’ve liquidated only 50 percent of total units available to sell instead of 75 percent—you may want to accelerate the markdown cadence, pulling forward the Initial Markdown Date so you reach yourtarget inventoryby the Liquidation Date
. It could look like this.Four weeks ahead of your Planned Initial Markdown Date, take 25 percent off the regular retail price and keep it there for—you guessed it—four weeks.When the fourth week elapses, take 40 percent off the regular retail price. Again, the new markdown price stays at the 40 percent discount for four weeks.Next, mark it down 60 percent off the regular retail price
. Hold the price for another four weeks, then discount the item 70 percent until it reaches its Liquidation Date.Markdown Optimization Process: ConclusionWhile the above method does not deliver all the benefits of anadvanced pricing solution, it goes a long way toward addressing the most egregious problems related to the liquidation of aging goods.Because this approach is tied to the peak selling period and the target liquidation rates, it compensates for a tardy start to the clearance process
. In addition, by setting a standard markdown cadence, it counters the tendency to take discounts that are too shallow to move through excess inventory. The method ties the markdown cadence to the liquidation performance of each item, giving you flexibility to respond to oversell and undersell situations.It’s important to emphasize that markdown cadences—especially Deferred and Accelerated—are highly subject to the retailer’s judgment and analysis
. You may elect to impose steeper discounts, elongate markdown periods, defer items to later Liquidation Dates, or take other actions based on the item’s performance,inventory levels, market conditions, etc.Markdown Optimization Process: That’s All, Folks!This wraps up my three-part series of blogs outlining a strong markdown optimization process for retailers who, for whatever reason, are not using advanced pricing analytics software.Part 1covers the markdown optimization process basics.Part 2covers how to

. This involves continuous monitoring and adjustment based on real-time sales data and feedback. Train your staff about the principles of markdown optimization and its business impact.Markdown optimization is a critical component of modern retail strategy. It requires a balance of analytical precision and market intuition. When executed correctly, it drives sales, improves profitability, and maintains brand integrity.For instance:Consider a major clothing retailer preparing for the end-of-season sale
. The retailer uses markdown optimization to manage the transition from winter to spring inventory.At the beginning of January, the retailer’s data analytics team analyzes sales patterns, inventory levels, and competitor pricing. They identify winter coats as a key category for markdowns. By examining customer purchase behavior, they determine that a 20% discount will attract buyers without drastically cutting into profit margins.The retailer sets the initial markdown for winter coats at 20%
. They monitor sales daily, using real-time data to assess the discount’s effectiveness. After two weeks, they noticed a significant increase in coat sales but still had a substantial inventory.Based on this data, the retailer implements a second phase of markdown optimization. They reduce the price of remaining winter coats by an additional 15%, resulting in a total discount of 35%. This second markdown pricing phase is timed strategically to coincide with a major promotional campaign
. This drove customer interest and sales.By the end of February, the retailer successfully clears out the majority of their winter coats. This process frees up valuable store space for new spring merchandise
. The retailer maximizes revenue from the remaining stock without resorting to extreme discounts that would diminish the brand’s perceived value.Markdown Optimization FactorsOptimize Markdown for SuccessOptimize Markdown for SuccessClearly define your goals—whether maximizing revenue from aged inventory, clearing space for new arrivals, or boosting sales in a specific category.Establish Successful Markdown CadenceSet strategic price changes with well-defined thresholds

Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) Explained Struggling with managing your inventory? High MOQs can lead to overstocking and extra costs, while low MOQs might leave you with too little stock. Balancing these can be tricky.We’ll break down what MOQ is, why suppliers set it, and how it affects your inventory. We’ll also explore how to find the right MOQ for your needs and address common challenges to optimize your stock levels. Dive in to learn how to manage MOQs effectively and keep your inventory under control
. Keep reading.What is Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)?Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) is the smallest number of units a supplier will produce anything or a retailer must buy. It helps ensure that production costs are covered. For retailers, MOQ defines the minimum number of units they need to order from the supplier.Every product has a different MOQ. It depends on several factors, like the cost to manufacture, the supply chain, and the nature of the product
. For example,SKUsthat are expensive to make may have a higher MOQ. This is because the supplier needs to justify the associated costs of production.Why Do Suppliers Set MOQs?MOQs set by suppliers help control their costs. By producing larger quantities of a product, they can save money. This is because larger orders reduce the cost per unit. For example, when producing in bulk, suppliers use materials, energy, and labor more efficiently
. Machines run longer, and workers stay focused on a single item for a longer period. This means less time is wasted on setup and switching tasks.Bulk production also uses fewer materials and less energy per unit. This makes it cheaper for the supplier to manufacture more finished goods at once. As a result, the supplier can reduce the per-unit price for larger orders. This benefits both the supplier and the buyer
. This benefits both the supplier and the buyer. The supplier makes a profit by producing efficiently, and the buyer gets a lower price per item.Efficiency and Cost ControlMOQ also helps suppliers manage their workflow. Producing larger orders means suppliers can plan better. They can buy materials in bulk and schedule production runs more efficiently. This reduces downtime and makes the entire process smoother
. Bulk buying of raw materials also helps reduce costs, as suppliers can negotiate lower prices with their suppliers. This, in turn, allows them to offer lower prices to their buyers.The Buyer’s PerspectiveWhile MOQs primarily help suppliers, they also benefit buyers. Retailers that can meet MOQ requirements oftentimes receive lower prices per unit. This allows them to maximize their profit margins. However, high MOQs can be a challenge for smaller businesses or startups
. They may not have enough capital to meet the suppliers’ MOQ or enough warehouse space for large quantities of inventory.Ensuring ProfitabilityManufacturers and wholesale distributors often rely on MOQs to stay profitable. Producing small quantity orders can be expensive. For instance, the costs of labor, materials, and machine setup may not be covered by small orders. If the supplier doesn’t set an MOQ, they could lose money on small orders
. By requiring a minimum quantity, they protect their profit margins.How is MOQ Different from EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) in the Supply Chain?MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) and EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) are important terms in supply chain management. While both relate to ordering products, they are different in many ways. Below are the key differences between MOQ and EOQ.1. PurposeMOQ is set by the supplier. It ensures the supplier can cover their costs and make a profit
. The main purpose of MOQ is to protect the supplier’s interests. For example, a supplier might set an MOQ of 500 units to make sure the order is large enough to justify the cost of production.EOQ, on the other hand, is used by the buyer. Its purpose is to minimize the buyer’s total costs. These costs include ordering, holding, and managing inventory. EOQ helps the buyer determine the most cost-effective order volume.2. ControlThe supplier controls MOQ
. ControlThe supplier controls MOQ. It is non-negotiable, and buyers must order at least the minimum amount of quantity. If the MOQ is 500 units, the buyer cannot order less. This makes MOQ a rigid rule that buyers must follow to do business with the supplier.EOQ is calculated by the buyer. The buyer has control over how much to order based on their inventory needs and costs. Unlike MOQ, EOQ is flexible. It can be adjusted as demand or costs change.3. FlexibilityMOQ is fixed
. FlexibilityMOQ is fixed. Once set by the supplier, it rarely changes unless there’s a major shift in production costs or supply chain dynamics. This can make it hard for smaller orders with a business to meet high MOQ.EOQ is much more flexible. It can be recalculated at any time. If the demand for a product spikes, the EOQ will also increase. Likewise, if holding costs go up, EOQ can be adjusted downward. This flexibility helps buyers respond to market changes.4
. Effect on Inventory LevelsMOQ often leads to higherinventory levels. If a business only needs 300 units but the MOQ is 500, they have to order more than they need. This can result in overstocking. Extra inventory can take up space and increase holding costs.EOQ is designed to optimize inventory levels. It helps the buyer order just enough to meet demandwithout overstocking or understocking
. This reduces the chance of excessinventoryand helps keep storage costs low.Types of MOQsMinimum Order Quantity (MOQ) isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Industries use various types of MOQs based on different products. It depends on their needs and production capabilities. Let’s take a closer look at the common types of MOQs and how they work.1. Standard MOQThis is the most common type. Suppliers set a fixed number of units that buyers must order
. It’s usually based on the cost of production and the supplier’s profit margins. For example, a manufacturer may set an MOQ of 500 units for a product. This ensures they can cover production costs and still make a profit. It’s straightforward but can be tough for smaller businesses that don’t need or can’t afford large quantities.2. Tiered MOQA tiered MOQ offers more flexibility. Instead of having a single MOQ, suppliers offer multiple order levels. The larger the order, the lower the per-unit price
. For example, you might see a supplier offer 100 units at one price, 500 units at a slightly lower price, and 1,000 units at an even lower price. This type of MOQ encourages buyers to order more to get a better deal, but it also gives them options.3. Value-Based MOQInstead of setting an MOQ based on the number of units, some suppliers set it based on the total value of the order. For example, a supplier may require a minimum order value of $5,000, regardless of the number of units purchased
. This is common in industries where products vary widely in price. Buyers can mix and match products to meet the minimum order value, giving them more control over their purchases.4. Time-Based MOQIn this case, the MOQ is set based on time, such as monthly or quarterly orders. Instead of placing one large order, buyers commit to ordering a minimum quantity over a specific period. This is common in industries with ongoing demand, such as retail or food supplies
. It helps suppliers manage production schedules while ensuring regular orders from customers.Calculating Minimum Order QuantityThe Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) is often determined based on production costs and desired profit margins
. While there isn’t a universal formula, a simplified version can be used to estimate MOQ:MOQ =Fixed Cost / (Selling Price per Unit – Variable Cost per Unit)Scenario:A manufacturer produces custom T-shirts.Fixed Costs:$10,000 (includes setup, machinery, etc.)Selling Price per Unit:$20Variable Costs per Unit:$8 (includes materials, labor, etc.)Let’s break it down:Determine Contribution Margin per Unit (Selling Price per Unit – Variable Cost per Unit).Contribution Margin per Unit= $20 – $8 = $12MOQ(as per the
Margin per Unit= $20 – $8 = $12MOQ(as per the above formula) = 10,000/12 = 834Result:The MOQ for the T-shirts is approximately 834 units
. This ensures that the fixed costs are covered and the manufacturer can achieve a profit.How Does High or Low MOQ Affect Inventory Management?Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) has a big impact on inventory management.High MOQA high MOQ means you must order a large quantity of products. This can lead to several issues:Overstocking: You might end up with more products than you can sell. This ties up capital and takes upstorage space.Holding Costs: More inventory means higher costs for storing and managing it
. This can reduce overall profitability.Risk of Obsolescence: If products become outdated or unsellable, you might lose money onexcess stock in your warehouse.Low MOQA low MOQ allows you to order smaller quantities. This can have several benefits:Reduced Inventory Costs: Less stock means lower storage and management costs. This helps in maintaining better cash flow.Less Risk: You reduce the risk of holding unsellable stock
. Ifdemand changes, you won’t be stuck with excess inventory.Flexibility: Smaller orders allow for more frequent adjustments to meet market trends and customer needs.Balancing MOQ with inventory needs is crucial. It helps maintain efficient operations and minimizes costs.ConclusionThe importance of MOQ is clear from the points discussed. In today’s volatile market with fluctuating prices and capital expenditures, finding the right balance is crucial

Managing inventory across multiple locations can seem daunting. With the right approach, it can be streamlined. Here’s a guide to making multi-location inventory management work for you. Keep reading
. Keep reading. What is Multi-Location Inventory Management? Managing multiple inventory places means keeping track of stock across various warehouses, stores, or distribution centers. This can be within one city or across different regions. The goal is simple: ensure each location has the right amount of stock to meet demand without excess or shortage. Why is Managing Multi-Location Inventory Crucial? Managing inventory in multiple locations isn’t just a logistical challenge
. It’s a crucial aspect of running a successful business. Let’s dive into why this is so important. 1. Boost Customer Satisfaction Imagine walking into a store and finding exactly what you want, right when you need it. This doesn’t happen by accident. Good warehouse management orinventory managementacross locations ensures that each store or warehouse has the right products in stock. When customers can find what they need, they’re happier. And happy customers are loyal customers
. And happy customers are loyal customers. They’re more likely to return and recommend your business to others. Effective inventory control makes sure that your products are available where they’re needed most. This means fewer missed sales and a better reputation for your business. Customers notice when their shopping experience is smooth and satisfying. 2. Balance Stock Levels Keeping inventory levels just rightrequires a powerplay of strategy and betteroperating tools
. Too much stock ties up cash and increases storage costs. Too little stock means missed sales and unhappy customers. Managing inventory well across multiple warehouses helps strike this balance. It ensures you have enough stock to meet demand without overstocking. For example, if you have a popular product thatsells quickly, you don’t want to run out. But you also don’t want excess inventory sitting idle. Multi-location management helps you distribute stock effectively, avoiding these issues
. This balance helps keep your cash flow healthy and your storage costs under control. 3. Improve Supply Chain Efficiency A well-managed inventory system enhances your entire supply chain. When you have accurate data on stock levels and movements, you can make better decisions. This means more precise ordering and fewer delays. Efficient inventory management reduces the risk of stockouts, where items are out of stock, and overstock, where there’s too much. Both of these issues can disrupt the supply chain
. With good inventory management, you can forecast demand better and adjust your supply chain accordingly. This makes your operations smoother and more reliable. 4. Increase Flexibility and Responsiveness Markets and customer preferences can change quickly. Having inventory spread across multiple locations gives you flexibility. You can respond faster to changing trends and customer needs. For instance, if a product is suddenly in high demand in one area, you can quickly transfer stock from another location
. This responsiveness helps you stay competitive. You’re not stuck with outdated stock or missing out on sales opportunities. 5. Optimize Operational Costs Managing inventory across various locations allows you to optimize your operational costs. It reduces excess inventory and the associated costs. Efficient inventory management can lead to better use of warehouse space and lower storage costs. Aalyze data from multiple locations, spot inefficiencies and make adjustments
. This might include shifting stock to locations where it’s needed more or improving your ordering processes. Efficient operations mean cost savings and better profitability. 6. Enhance Data Accuracy and Reporting Having a centralized inventory system improves data accuracy. When all locations use the same system, you get a clear, unified view of inventory levels. This accuracy is essential for making informed business decisions
. Detailed and accurate reports enable you to understand inventory trends and performance. With this data, you can plan better, forecast demand, and manage stock more effectively. 7. Reduce Risk and Improve Compliance Effective inventory management helps reduce risks related to stockouts, overstocking, and spoilage. It also ensures compliance with industry regulations. Managing inventory across multiple locations means you can better track and control stock, reducing the risk of errors and issues
. By keeping accurate records and maintaining good practices, you stay compliant with regulations. This helps avoid legal issues and potential fines. Multi-location inventory management is crucial for boosting customer satisfaction, balancing stock levels, improving supply chain efficiency, increasing flexibility, optimizing costs, enhancing data accuracy, and reducing risk. It’s not just about keeping track of inventory; it’s about running a smooth, efficient, and customer-focused business
. How to Successfully Manage Multi-Location Inventory? 1. Centralize Your Data Centralizing data means all your inventory information is in one place. This helps with accuracy and consistency. How? Use an integrated inventory system that brings together data from all locations. Ensure it updates in real-time and provides detailed reports. 2. Standardize Processes Standard processes across locations make operations smoother and reduce errors. Create clear procedures for inventory tasks
. Create clear procedures for inventory tasks. Train all staff to follow these procedures. 3. Track Inventory in Real-Time Real-time tracking provides up-to-date information on inventory levels and movements. This helps prevent stock issues. Use barcodes or RFID tags with your inventory management software. Ensure the system integrates well with other tools. 4. Optimize Replenishment Efficient replenishment keeps inventory levels just right, avoiding both shortages and overstock
. Set automated reorder points based on past data and forecasts. Adjust these points for seasonal trends. 5. Leverage Data Analytics Data analytics give you insights into inventory trends and demand patterns. This helps in making better decisions. Analyze inventory data regularly. Use these insights to adjust stock levels and improve turnover. 6. Enhance Communication Good communication ensures all locations are aligned and can quickly address issues. Hold regular meetings and updates between locations
. Use tools that make sharing information easy. Challenges in Multi-Location Inventory Management 1. Visibility Issues Tracking inventory across multiple locations can be tricky. It’s easy for data to become outdated or inaccurate. This lack of visibility can lead to several problems. For instance, you might not know when stock levels are low until it’s too late. Delayed updates mean that inventory records might not reflect the actual stock on hand
. This can result in stockouts, where customers can’t get what they want. It can also lead to overstock, where you have too much of anunused item. Both situations are costly and can hurt your business. To solve this, you need a real-time tracking system. This system should update automatically and provide accurate information about stock levels and movements. Regular audits of your inventory data are also crucial. They help catch discrepancies and ensure everything matches up. 2
. 2. Inconsistent Processes Different locations might follow different procedures for managing inventory. This inconsistency can lead to errors and inefficiencies. For example, one location might track stock manually, while another uses an automated system. These different approaches can create confusion and discrepancies. Without standardized procedures you could miss important steps. This inconsistency can also lead to varying levels of service quality across locations
. Create and enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) to improve inconsistencies. Ensure all locations follow the same guidelines. 3. High Costs Managing inventory across multiple locations can become expensive. Storage costs, transportation expenses, and technology investments can all impact your bottom line. For instance, having excess inventory ties up cash. To control this,reviewyour inventory processes regularly. Look for areas where you can reduce unnecessary expenses
. Negotiating better rates with suppliers and exploring betterinventory management toolscan be a game-changer. Investing in technology that improves efficiency might have a higher upfront cost but can save money in the long run. Solutions to Manage Multiple Inventory Locations 1. Improve Visibility To tackle visibility issues, implement a unifiedinventory management system. Track inventory across locations, and measure stock levels and movements as they happen. Regular auditsare also important
. Regular auditsare also important. They help ensure that the data in your system matches the actual inventory. This practice helps catch any discrepancies early, preventing bigger issues down the line. 2. Ensure Consistency Consistency is key to smooth operations. Develop standard procedures for inventory management across all locations. These procedures should be clear and easy to follow. Train your staff thoroughly to ensure they understand and follow the procedures
. Regularly review and update these standards as needed. Maintain consistency, reduce the risk of errors and improve overall efficiency. 3. Control Costs Managing costs is crucial for maintaining profitability. Start by reviewing your inventory processes to identify areas where expenses can be reduced. Look for inefficiencies, such as excess inventory or unnecessary storage costs. Negotiate with suppliers for better rates and explore options for cost-effective technology
. Investing in tools that improve inventory management can reduce long-term costs. While the initial investment might be high, the savings in efficiency and accuracy can be significant. 💡FactDid you know? Setting up a warehouse near delivery locations can reduce distribution costs by 25%, according to McKinsey & Company. Multi-Location Inventory Management Best Practices 1. Invest in Technology Technology plays a vital role in effective inventory management
. Advanced tools can enhance how you track and manage stock. Consider using automated systems that update in real time. Real-time tracking helps keep accurate records and prevents stock issues. Data analytics tools can also provide valuable insights. They help you understand inventory trends and make better decisions. Investing in the right technology can improve efficiency and accuracy across all locations. 2. Review Performance Regularly Regular performance reviewsare essential
. They help you assess how well your inventory management is working. Use these reviews to identify areas for improvement. Check key metrics such as stock turnover rates and order accuracy. Based on your findings, make adjustments to optimize your inventory levels and processes. Regular reviews ensure that your inventory management remains effective and responsive to changes. 3. Prepare for Disruptions Unexpected disruptions can impact your inventory management
. It’s important to have a plan in place to handle these issues. This plan should address potential problems such as supply chain disruptions or sudden changes in demand. By preparing for disruptions, you can minimize their impact on your operations. Develop contingency plans and communicate them to your team. Being prepared helps you manage challenges without significant setbacks. 4. Foster Collaboration Collaboration between locations improves overall performance
. Encourage regular communication and teamwork. When locations work together, they can solve problems more effectively and share best practices.

NYC Leads the Way as GLP-1 Drug Use Reshapes America’s Retail Size Curves To succeed, fashion and apparel retailers need to get almost everything right—that includes accurately forecasting clothing sizes to meet customer demands, which is certainly one of the industry’s central, perennial, and most frustrating challenges
. As we explored in ourlatest white paper, this maddeningly shape-shifting challenge is being further scrambled by consumers’ uptake of GLP-1 drugs.As we continually monitor this phenomenon’s effects so we may better advise our clients—and just because we’re really into this stuff—we decided to zero in on New York City, where GLP-1 drug use has exploded, particularly among the non-diabetic population

Managing Pipeline Inventory in 2025 You face constant pressure to keep the right products on the shelves—without overstocking or missing sales. Do you feel like your supply chain often lets you down? Perhaps you’re fighting stockouts one week, and the next, you’re drowning in unsold goods. These issues are not just about inventory—they’re about how you understand and manage pipeline inventory
. But what exactly is pipeline inventory, and why does it feel like such a puzzle to solve?Pipeline inventory is the often-overlooked part of your stock that is in transit, between suppliers and stores. The problem? Most retailers don’t track it effectively. And this gap leads to poor stock availability, missed sales, and wasted money. The real solution is understanding pipeline inventory in a way that actually helps you control your supply chain more effectively
. In this blog, let’s dive into why pipeline inventory is your secret weapon—and how mastering it can transform your retail business. We got you covered!What is Pipeline Stock in Inventory Management?Pipeline inventory refers to inventory that is‘in motion’through yoursupply chain. It’s the stock that’s ordered but not yet received or that’s in transit to stores, warehouses, or fulfillment centers
. In contrast, decoupled inventory refers to stock deliberately kept separate from pipeline flows to serve as a buffer against supply chain disruptions or fluctuations in demand.Here’s where things get tricky: retail depends on the timing of the pipeline inventory. Miss a beat, and you either end up withempty shelvesorexcess stock
. The challenge is not just knowing that inventory is in the pipeline, but understanding when it will arrive, how much pipeline inventory is actually coming, and how this affects your current stock.Understanding Pipeline Inventory in Retail?Pipeline inventory can make or break your operations. Why? Because without visibility, you’re essentially flying blind. When you can’t see your inventory in transit, you make decisions based on the inventory on hand, not on what’s coming through the pipeline
. This results in missed opportunities forsmarter stock management.Retailers today need to shift their thinking. Managing pipeline inventory isn’t just about tracking deliveries; it’s about predicting demand and having enough supply to meet it at the right time, with zero waste. It’s about understanding how your supply chain moves—and optimizing it.Pipeline Inventory FormulaThe formulaDemand Rate * Lead Timeis often used as a starting point for understanding pipeline inventory
. However, this traditional approach falls short when applied to the complexities of modern retail supply chains.Advanced inventory planning and optimization solutions redefine this process by leveraging AI/ML forecasting to create highly accurate, forward-looking predictions
. Unlike static calculations, these systems integrate hundreds of internal and external factors, including:Seasonality and promotional calendars.Shifting consumer trends and regional variations.Historical and real-time sales insights.In advanced systems, this basic formula is enhanced through dynamic adjustments. For example:When you factor these elements into your pipeline calculations, you’ll be closer to real-time inventory visibility
. And that’s where retailers can start to unlock real operational efficiencies
. For instance:AI forecasting tools account for fluctuations in demand caused by seasonal trends, promotions, or external disruptions.Service level targets are achieved using sophisticated methodologies, such as the Kings Method, ensuring precise stock availability without overstocking.Historical lead times and variability are analyzed to improve lead time predictions, minimizing delays or disruptions.Starting with a simplified formula provides a baseline, but modern supply chain management demands a
but modern supply chain management demands a deeper, more adaptable approach
. By incorporating dynamic factors such as demand variability and lead time fluctuations, pipeline inventory evolves from a basic calculation into a powerful tool for driving operational efficiency and meeting customer demand with precision.Benefits of Pipeline Stock ManagementManaging pipeline inventory isn’t just about having the right stock at the right time—it’s about transforming potential risks into competitive advantages
. The key lies in leveraging pipeline inventory practices that keep yoursupply chainagile, responsive, and cost-effective. Here’s how managing pipeline inventory can unlock hidden benefits for your business:1. Anticipate Shortages and Reduce StockoutsWithout visibility into pipeline inventory, it’s easy to miss the signs of an impending stockout. Real-time tracking helps you anticipate shortages before they occur
. When you can see how much product is in transit and when it’s expected to arrive, you gain the upper hand in preventing stockouts. By adjusting your orders based on in-transit inventory levels, you can act early and reorder in time, ensuring product availability. This proactive approach stops customers from walking away due to unavailable stock and keeps your sales flowing.2
. Smooth Out the Supply Chain BottlenecksEvery supply chain faces disruptions—whether due to late shipments, weather, or demand spikes. Without pipeline visibility, these disruptions can lead to chaos. By managing pipeline inventory effectively, you’re not left scrambling when something goes wrong. You’ll have the foresight to adjust on the fly, shifting inventory where it’s needed most or even diverting shipments to avoid a bottleneck
. With the right data, you stay prepared and in control, ensuring your operations flow smoothly even when external factors threaten to disrupt them.3. Improve Cash Flow by Reducing Excess StockExcess stock is tied-up cash—money that could be used elsewhere in your business. By gaining control over pipeline inventory, you prevent overordering and reduce the need for excessive safety stock
. The visibility of your inventory in transit lets you fine-tune your purchasing and stocking decisions, aligning your orders more closely with actual demand. This dynamic approach minimizes the chance of carrying excess inventory that doesn’t sell, allowing you to optimize cash flow and reinvest capital into more productive areas of your business.4. Enhanced Vendor RelationshipsEffective pipelineinventory managementgoes beyond optimizing internal processes—it strengthens external partnerships too
. When you track pipeline inventory in real time, you have a clearer understanding of when products will arrive, and whether there are any delays. This transparency makes it easier to communicate with suppliers, ensuring that delivery windows are met, and expectations are aligned
. Vendors appreciate knowing their customers are on top of their orders, which can lead to more favorable terms, better service, and an overall stronger partnership.Challenges of Pipeline Inventory Management SystemWhile pipeline inventory can transform your operations, it’s not a silver bullet. There are distinct challenges that many retailers face when managing their pipeline inventory, and these can undermine your efforts if not addressed properly
. Here’s what no one tells you about these challenges—and how to navigate them effectively:1. Uncertainty Around Lead TimesOne of the biggest hurdles in managing pipeline inventory is the unpredictability of lead times. Global supply chains are subject to constant change, and numerous factors can throw off even the mostaccurate inventory forecasts: transportation delays, supplier issues, labor shortages, weather disruptions, or even unexpecteddemand fluctuations
. The challenge for retailers is that lead times aren’t static—they vary, often without warning. To manage this, you need flexible inventory tracking that can quickly adapt to changes in lead times. This includes using systems that can dynamically adjust timelines as new information becomes available, and maintaining buffer stock for those inevitable moments when delays occur. Flexibility is key in making sure your inventory stays on track, regardless of these unpredictable changes.2
. Lack of Real-Time DataWithout access to real-time data, you’re working with outdated information—an issue that can seriously hamper your ability to make informed decisions. When inventory in transit isn’t tracked in real time, you risk basing decisions on assumptions, not facts. For example, you may think that more stock is on its way when, in reality, it’s delayed or under-shipped
. This kind of miscalculation leads to either overordering, which ties up capital in unnecessary inventory, or underordering, which causes stockouts. Real-time data gives you the confidence to make decisions based on the latest updates, ensuring that your inventory is always aligned withactual demand and supply. With this kind of visibility, you can avoid costly errors and operate with precision.3
. Inconsistent Communication Across ChannelsRetailers often work with a variety of partners and stakeholders—suppliers, third-party logistics providers, and internal teams. Each of these parties has its own processes and communication channels, and when those don’t align, the flow of information can break down. For pipeline inventory, this misalignment can lead to missed deliveries, untracked shipments, or confusion about what’s in transit and what’s already arrived
. A major challenge for retailers is ensuring that all channels are connected and data is shared seamlessly. A lack of integration between systems can cause critical information about pipeline inventory to fall through the cracks, leading to delays, stockouts, or inaccurate forecasts. The solution is to implement an integrated, unified pipeline inventory system that connects all stakeholders, providing everyone with a single source of truth
. This improves communication, reduces errors, and keeps everyone on the same page, from suppliers to the back office.4. Complex Product Flows Across Multiple ChannelsProduct flows can become complicated. Inventory moves not only from suppliers to stores but also between fulfillment centers, warehouses, and e-commerce platforms. The complexity increases when you have different lead times for various channels or when orders are being fulfilled from multiple locations
. This multi-channel pipeline can create friction if not managed properly. Retailers need to track inventory across all these touchpoints to ensure that products are where they need to be when they need to be there. Missing the mark on even one channel can result in stock imbalances, missed sales, and lost revenue
. The key is to have an omnichannel inventory system that connects and tracks all product flows in real time, ensuring that every channel gets the stock it needs when it needs it.Retail Use Cases of Pipeline Inventory System: Going Beyond the BasicsThe beauty of pipeline inventory is that it’s not just for large retailers—it’s for anyone who wants to improve supply chain efficiency
. Here are unique ways pipeline inventory is changing the game:Luxury Retailers:For high-demand items like limited-edition products, pipeline inventory ensures that every item arrives on time and is available for launch. Without pipeline visibility, you risk releasing a product without the necessary stock to back it up.E-commerce Retailers:E-commerce relies heavily on timely deliveries to customers
. Pipeline inventory allows you to manage in-transit stock, ensuring that items ordered from suppliers are not only in the pipeline but will arrive in time to fulfill customer expectations.Consumer Goods:In industries with rapidly changing consumer preferences, pipeline inventory lets you keep pace. By knowing how long products are in transit, you can adjust your replenishment strategy before stock levels drop.ConclusionMastering pipeline inventory isn’t just a nice-to-have in retail—it’s a game changer
. It’s the tool that helps you stay ahead of stockouts, improve operational efficiency, and reduce holding costs
. By understanding and optimizing your pipeline inventory, you can stop guessing and start making better, more informed decisions.Take the Next StepReady to optimize your pipeline inventory?

And an opportunity.There are some assumptions that must hold true for any promotion to be relevant to the target consumer:The timing of the promotion must be aligned with customer needs—Depending on the geography, promoting winter coats is more likely to be relevant in December than in June.The offered price must be compelling—The customer’s evaluation of the price impact may be based on knowledge of the competitive marketplace or on a comparison of prior prices from the same outlet (i.e., “was/now”

Psychological Pricing Strategies, Definition and Techniques Unleash the hidden power of psychological pricing! Go beyond basicpricing modelsand delve into the minds of your customers. This guide equips you with the most effective pricing strategies to skyrocket sales and attract new customers.We’ll guide you in leveraging consumer psychology to maximize demand and outpace your competitors. Unlock your business’s true potential and dominate the market
. Keep reading!What is Psychological Pricing?Psychologicalpricingis not just about numbers. It’s a strategic tool in the arsenal of every business. It’s about understanding human behavior and leveraging that knowledge to influence purchasing decisions. Instead of relying solely on cost-based pricing models, psychological pricing takes a deeper dive into consumer psychology.By tapping into the intricate workings of the human mind, psychological pricing aims to shape perceptions of value and drive sales
. It recognizes that consumers are not always rational actors but are influenced by a myriad of psychological factors when making purchasing decisions.Psychologicalpricingrelies on common cognitive biases. It includes the anchoring effect and the left-digit bias. By presenting a higher-priced option first, you establish a reference point (or anchor) that makes subsequent options seem more reasonable and enticing
. Additionally, ending prices with .99 or .95 creates the illusion of a bargain, tapping into consumers’ tendency to focus on the leftmost digits of a price.Pricing psychology is about what drives consumer behavior and using that knowledge to your advantage. It’s about creating a pricingstrategythat works—resonates with your target audience and compels them to make a purchase.It’s not just about setting prices
. It’s about understanding the psychology behind those prices and leveraging it to maximize profitability. So, the next time you’re setting prices for your products or services, remember the power of psychological pricing and put the best foot forward. Let’s look at different psychological pricing strategies.Psychological Pricing Strategies1. Price AnchoringPrice anchoring leverages the human tendency to focus on the first piece of information given
. By setting a high initial price, the “anchor,” you establish a reference that makes later prices seem more reasonable. This effect persuades customers to view subsequent offers as bargains, despite a high starting point. This tactic is crucial to launch new products or premium items.For example—a software company introduces three pricing plans: a premium plan at $99 per month, a standard at $49, and a basic at $19
. With the $99 anchor, the other plans appear more accessible, boosting their appeal.💡FactDo you know91%of Americans check for discounts before making a purchase?2. Charm PricingCharm pricing uses the simple trick of ending prices with the digit 9. This strategy taps into how consumers see prices ending in 9 as much lower than their rounded counterparts. For instance, most people view $19.99 as closer to $19 than $20
. By using charm pricing, businesses create the illusion of a bargain, increasing the appeal of their products or services.This approach is common inretailand hospitality. Especially among price-sensitive shoppers who look for perceived savings. Charm pricing is often used in salespromotions, clearance events, or everyday pricing. It encourages customers to purchase on the allure of a good deal
. Its widespread recognition also makes it a low-risk, go-to strategy for businesses around the world.For example—imagine a clothing store that’s introducing a new line of jeans. The store sets the price of these jeans at $39.99 instead of $40. Even though the price difference is only one cent, the price tag ending in “.99” makes the jeans appear significantly cheaper to most consumers
. This perception comes from the initial ‘3’ in $39.99, which consumers subconsciously process as being closer to $30 than to $40, making them more likely to consider it a bargain and thus more likely to buy.💡FactDid you know the charm pricing strategy—which involves ending prices in 9 or 99—boosts sales by24%?3. Decoy PricingDecoy pricing is a clever tactic that involves adding a less attractive option—the decoy—to make other choices look better
. The decoy’s price guides customers towards a target option that appears to offer the best value. This strategy uses consumers’ habit of comparing options against each other, not on their own merits.By using a decoy, businesses give the illusion of choice while nudging consumers towards a preferred product. This psychological pricing method is popular in industries like hospitality, electronics, and subscription services. It aims to boost sales by influencing decision-making
. When used effectively, decoy pricing drives both customer decisions and business revenue.For example—a movie theatre offers three popcorn sizes: small for $3, medium for $6.50, and large for $7. The medium-sized popcorn acts as a decoy. It is not much cheaper than the large one, but much more expensive than the small one. This pricing strategy makes the large popcorn appear to be a great deal in comparison—it’s only 50 cents more than the medium but offers significantly more popcorn
. Consequently, most customers are likely to choose the large, seeing it as the best value for their money. This is a classic example of psychological pricing—decoy pricing, where the medium option is strategically priced to push customers towards the large popcorn.4. Bundle pricingBundlepricingis a pricing strategy where businesses offer multiple products or services together at a discount. This approach boosts value perception, enticing customers with savings and the convenience of one purchase
. Businesses bundle related items to increase transaction value. This psychological pricing strategy works well in sectors like telecommunications, software, and entertainment.For example—a telecommunications company might bundle internet, cable TV, and phone services at a lower rate than buying each separately. This attracts price-sensitive customers, builds loyalty, and sets the company apart from competitors who sell services individually.5
. Flat-Rate BidsFlat-rate bids, or fixed-price bidding, mean quoting one price for a service, no matter the work involved. This strategy offers simplicity and transparency, removing the uncertainty that comes with hourly or variable pricing. Customers appreciate knowing the cost upfront, which enables them to make decisions without fear of unexpected fees. Service-based businesses like freelancers, contractors, and consultants often use this approach
. It simplifies the quoting process and builds trust.For example—a graphic designer might charge a flat $1,000 to create a company logo, no matter how many revisions are needed. Flat-rate bids lead to quicker project approvals, higher client satisfaction, and fewer disputes about charges.6. Price AppearanceAppearance pricing refers to how businesses present prices to customers. It aims to show value and justify the asking price
. This strategy highlights a product or service’s features, benefits, and unique selling points. It emphasizes its value proposition instead of just focusing on the price. Price appearance works well for premium or luxury products and services. These are where quality, exclusivity, and brand perception are crucial.For example—a high-end automobile manufacturer might highlight the advanced technology, superior craftsmanship, and prestigious brand heritage of its vehicles
. This is to justify their premium prices. By enhancing the perceived value of their offerings, businesses charge higher prices. They also stand out from competitors and attract affluent or discerning customers who value quality.Psychological Pricing TechniquesIn addition to overarching marketing strategies, businesses also employ specific techniques to implement psychological pricing effectively
. These techniques delve into the nuances of consumer psychology, exploiting cognitive biases and heuristics to shape purchasing decisions. Here are some key techniques.1. Price FramingPrice framing involves presenting prices in a way that influences how they are perceived. This technique of psychological pricing includes emphasizing the value proposition of a product, highlighting savings compared to competitor prices, or framing prices in terms of small, digestible increments (e.g., daily or weekly rates)
. By framing prices in a favorable light, businesses enhance perceived value and encourage consumers to make purchases.2. Scarcity and UrgencyCreating a sense of scarcity or urgency drives consumer behavior by tapping into the fear of missing out (FOMO). Limited-time offers countdown timers, and low-stock alerts are all techniques used to instil a sense of urgency and prompt immediate action
. By leveraging the psychological principle of loss aversion, businesses compel consumers to act quickly to secure a perceived valuable opportunity.3. Social ProofSocial proof involves leveraging the power of social influence to sway consumer behavior. Testimonials, reviews, ratings, and endorsements from satisfied customers serve as powerful forms of social proof, reassuring potential buyers and validating their decision to purchase
. By highlighting the experiences of others, businesses instill confidence and credibility, mitigating perceived risks associated with making a purchase.4. PersonalizationPersonalization involves tailoring pricing and promotional offers to individual consumer preferences and behaviors. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, businesses segment their customer base and deliver targeted pricing incentives, discounts, or promotions tailored to each customer’s unique needs and preferences
. Personalized pricing not only enhances the customer experience but also increases the likelihood of conversion by delivering relevant and timely offers.5. A/B TestingA/B testing, also known as split testing, involves experimenting with different types of psychological pricing strategies and measuring their psychological impact on consumer behavior
. By systematically varying elements such as price points, product positioning, and promotional offers, businesses identify the most effective pricing tactics and refine their strategies accordingly. A/B testing provides valuable insights into consumer preferences and allows businesses to optimize their pricing strategies for maximum impact and profitability.ConclusionPsychological pricing offers a powerful yet nuanced approach to influencing customer behavior and driving sales growth

Retail Price Optimization: 5 Steps to Profitability through Markdowns Retailers have a love-hate relationship with markdowns. Love to quickly clear out unwanted inventory (and recoup at least some money) and hate not getting full price.Markdowns are virtually inevitable; it’s just not possible to always satisfy customer demand exactly. So they are both a useful tool and a necessary evil.You mustn’t treat the process as an afterthought
. Doing so is both inefficient and ineffective, costing you in diminished profits and margin losses
. Just to move inventory that could have yielded profit with the right approach.But even using traditional markdown methods—relying on experience and consistent trends over the years—is problematic in today’s dynamic environment, which demands extraordinarily nimble, well informed, and data-driven, insightful decision making.As we entered 2023, only 30 percent of US retailers were confident about maintaining positive margins and profits1
. Thanks to inflation, even though average weekly income in the US rose 8.3 percent since December 2020, real earnings have fallen by 5 percent2. Not surprisingly, many consumers are prioritizing essentials over discretionary purchases.Retail inventories are piling up. Out come the markdowns.Five Components to Creating a Smart Markdown StrategyA smart markdown strategy requires you to have a holistic view of your portfolio and an understanding of the factors affecting various SKUs
. One-size-fits-all approaches will not work.1) Focus on the Right KPIsStart by identifying the right key performance indicators (KPIs) for every product across its entire lifecycle and continuously monitor, measure, and adjust. Do this properly and you won’t miss opportunities or unexpectedly be forced to accept margin losses. Something as simple as having monthly targets works towards ensuring you keep track of expected vs
. actuals.Bear in mind you’ll have to fine-tune your KPIs for different stores and marketsto get the best out of any markdown strategy. What works for one store or market likely won’t be as effective for others; you’ll need to consider factors such as seasonality, local events, and demography
. Localizing your markdown strategies will prevent margin losses from a high demand market while also ensuring you clear out inventories from markets with fading demand.2) Know the Price Elasticity of Key Value ItemsThere’s no substitute for knowing the price point at which a product has the highest propensity to sell.

Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Establishment Survey,” sourced through Haver Analytics in November 2022. Retailers have a love-hate relationship with markdowns
. Love to quickly clear out unwanted inventory (and recoup at least some money) and hate not getting full price. Markdowns are virtually inevitable; it’s just not possible to always satisfy customer demand exactly. So they are both a useful tool and a necessary evil. You mustn’t treat the process as an afterthought. Doing so is both inefficient and ineffective, costing you in diminished profits and margin losses. Just to move inventory that could have yielded profit with the right approach
. But even using traditional markdown methods—relying on experience and consistent trends over the years—is problematic in today’s dynamic environment, which demands extraordinarily nimble, well informed, and data-driven, insightful decision making. As we entered 2023, only 30 percent of US retailers were confident about maintaining positive margins and profits1. Thanks to inflation, even though average weekly income in the US rose 8.3 percent since December 2020, real earnings have fallen by 5 percent2
. Not surprisingly, many consumers are prioritizing essentials over discretionary purchases. Retail inventories are piling up. Out come the markdowns. Five Components to Creating a Smart Markdown Strategy A smart markdown strategy requires you to have a holistic view of your portfolio and an understanding of the factors affecting various SKUs. One-size-fits-all approaches will not work
. One-size-fits-all approaches will not work. 1) Focus on the Right KPIs Start by identifying the right key performance indicators (KPIs) for every product across its entire lifecycle and continuously monitor, measure, and adjust. Do this properly and you won’t miss opportunities or unexpectedly be forced to accept margin losses. Something as simple as having monthly targets works towards ensuring you keep track of expected vs. actuals
. actuals. Bear in mind you’ll have to fine-tune your KPIs for different stores and marketsto get the best out of any markdown strategy. What works for one store or market likely won’t be as effective for others; you’ll need to consider factors such as seasonality, local events, and demography. Localizing your markdown strategies will prevent margin losses from a high demand market while also ensuring you clear out inventories from markets with fading demand
. 2) Know the Price Elasticity of Key Value Items There’s no substitute for knowing the price point at which a product has the highest propensity to sell. Price elasticity is a key factor here. Understanding elasticity—elastic products really move when you reduce the price; inelastic products, not so much—in your portfolio’s Key Value Items (KVIs) will maximize the odds you get the most profit per product

. Devising these strategies means answering multiple questions across key business domains:Pricing Implications of Increased TariffsTariff increases can lead to direct cost increases for retailers that rely on imported goods. This can affect pricing in the following ways:Cost-Pass-Through:Retailers may choose to pass the additional costs (partially/fully) directly onto consumers, increasing shelf prices
. This strategy can maintain margins but may reduce demand if consumers resist higher prices.Margin Compression:In categories where price elasticity is high, retailers might absorb the increased costs to maintain price competitiveness, which can reduce profit margins.Price Tiering Adjustments:Retailers might reconsider their price tiers and restructure assortments, especially in discretionary categories like luxury goods, where the price points are already high.Why is AI Critical in Managing Tariffs While

Where the rubber meets the road, the result of this exercise will be definitive answers, at the SKU level as to where to preserve the margin, pass on the cost, and adjust as needed
. Given the volatility of tariffs, this exercise should be repeated periodically, and then AI can take care of the rest.1
. Factors to Consider in Pricing AdjustmentsFor effective pricing decisions, retailers must evaluate several key factors:Demand Elasticity:How sensitive is demand to price changes in each category? For instance, consumers may be more price-sensitive in categories like groceries or basic apparel than in luxury items.Key Value Items (KVIs):KVIs are products with high price sensitivity and visibility that consumers often use to judge a retailer’s price competitiveness
. Retailers must decide whether to absorb tariff costs on KVIs to maintain a competitive edge.Competitive Landscape:Retailers need to monitor competitors’ responses to tariff increases
. If competitors absorb costs while maintaining low prices, matching price hikes could hurt market share.Consumer Perception and Loyalty:Price increases on essential items may erode consumer trust and loyalty, especially if other retailers choose not to pass on the cost increase.Illustration of how different pricing strategies can be applied:2
. Product-Specific ConsiderationsEach product category is affected differently by tariff increases, depending on consumer perception, price sensitivity, and the retailer’s strategic priorities.Luxury GoodsImpact:Luxury items, including high-end fashion and electronics, often have less price elasticity
. Consumers purchasing luxury goods are generally more resilient to price increases, allowing retailers to pass on the cost without significantly impacting demand.Strategy:Retailers could increase prices proportionally with the cost rise. For instance, a luxury handbag previously priced at $1,000 might increase to $1,100 if a 10% tariff is added. Margin preservation is usually prioritized in this segment.ApparelImpact:Apparel is often price-sensitive, with many low- to mid-range brands facing competition
. A small price increase can result in a noticeable drop in demand.Strategy:Retailers could selectively pass on costs in less price-sensitive segments, such as premium lines while absorbing the increase in basics like T-shirts or jeans
. A mix of cost-sharing and careful promotional strategies may help maintain demand.ElectronicsImpact:Electronics face strong competition, with consumers highly price-aware and likely to shop around for deals.Strategy:Retailers might need to partially absorb the increased tariff costs, particularly on popular models, or negotiate with suppliers for shared cost mitigation
. Promotions or bundling might help justify slight price increases without deterring consumers.Essential Goods (e.g., Groceries)Impact:Essentials are highly elastic and directly influence a retailer’s image. Price increases on KVIs like milk or bread can quickly impact consumer perception.Strategy:For essential goods, retailers might avoid passing on tariffs to maintain competitiveness and loyalty. Instead, they could manage costs by reducing margins slightly or re-evaluating supply chain efficiencies.3
. Adaptive Strategies: Focus on KVIsFor categories containing KVIs, the following strategies help mitigate the effects of increased tariffs:Selective Cost Absorption:Absorb the added costs on high-profile KVIs, such as certain fresh produce items or staple groceries, to maintain competitive price points.Cross-Category Margin Balancing:Increase prices on less sensitive items within the same category to offset the losses from KVIs
. For instance, a retailer may keep prices stable on KVIs like milk and bread while slightly increasing prices on premium cheeses.Supply Chain Negotiations:Negotiate with suppliers for shared cost burdens or explore alternative sourcing options to mitigate tariff effects.How a thorough KVC/KVI Analysis can be done:Illustrative Scenario of Two Different Items Based on ElasticityExample 1: White T-Shirt (Inelastic Item)Basic white T-shirts are a staple in any wardrobe and tend to be inelastic, meaning price

. However, given that this is a core item, most shoppers will accept a small price increase without much drop in demand
. The retailer could also choose to keep the price at $100 and absorb the $4 increase, keeping it attractive to consumers and maintaining volume.Key Takeaway: For core products like white T-shirts, even a minor price hike likely won’t deter buyers, so retailers have the flexibility to either absorb the cost or pass it on with little impact on sales.Example 2: Trendy Sunglasses (Elastic Item)Seasonal, trendy items like sunglasses are much more price-sensitive

Consumers are often willing to switch to a cheaper alternative or wait for a sale.Original Cost:$15Retail Price Before Tariff:$30Cost with 10% Tariff:$16.50If the retailer raises the price to $33 to cover the tariff, it risks losing customers who might view the higher price as less justifiable for a non-essential item
. A smarter approach might be a smaller increase, say to $31, or keeping the price at $30 but absorbing the cost increase to preserve demand.Key Takeaway:For elastic items like trendy sunglasses, even a small price hike can drive customers away

The Return of Tariffs: Are Retailers Prepared for the Coming Storm? Tariffs are making a comeback, and they’re about to shake up the retail industry again. For businesses in apparel, footwear, furniture, and consumer goods, this isn’t just another regulatory hurdle—it’s a potential game-changer. The stakes? Higher costs, disrupted supply chains, and tougher competition
. If the trade war of 2018–2019 taught us anything, it’s this: tariffs don’t just impact global politics—they hit your bottom line, your customers, and your strategy.Think back to that era. Import prices soared, consumer wallets tightened, and retailers scrambled to adapt. Now, as a new wave of tariffs looms, it’s critical to learn from those missteps
. Why did some businesses weather the storm better than others? And more importantly, how can you position yourself to navigate what might be an even tougher challenge ahead?This isn’t a time for panic; it’s a time for preparation. By understanding where past theories went wrong and what practical strategies worked, you can minimize disruptions and even find opportunities amid the chaos
. Let’s break down lessons from the past, dissect why this tariff era could be worse, and explore actionable strategies to keep your business resilient and competitive.Are you ready to face the tariff era head-on? Continue reading.Lessons From the 2018–2019 U.S.-China Trade WarThe 2018–2019 trade war between the U.S. and China serves as a valuable case study. Over $350 billion worth of Chinese imports faced tariffs, causing a ripple effect across industries
. For retailers, this period left long-lasting scars, as import prices skyrocketed and consumer spending patterns shifted.Most of the Tariffs Were Passed to Customers—In the Short-TermOne of the most striking outcomes of the trade war was the near-total pass-through of tariffs to consumersin the short term. While this went relatively unnoticed in 2018, given the current economic environment, this is very unlikely this time around.According to theNational Bureau of Economic Research(NBER) Working Paper No
. 26610, import prices increased nearly one-to-one with tariffs in the initial months following their imposition. Retailers struggled to negotiate new contracts or pivot supply chains immediately, leaving them to absorb costs temporarily before passing them on to consumers.Furniture: The25%tariff on Chinese furniture imports drove costs significantly higher. Import volumes dropped, and profitability for retailers suffered as businesses struggled to renegotiate terms with suppliers
. Eventually, these higher costs were passed on to consumers, reducing demand.Apparel and Footwear: In 2018,34%of U.S. apparel importsand53%of footwear importscame from China. Tariffs on these goods led to sharp price hikes, directly impacting demand for price-sensitive items. However, in the longer term, many retailers managed to secure better vendor agreements, easing some of the burden.Economic Costs to HouseholdsFor the average U.S. household, the short-term financial toll of tariffs was substantial
. According to theCongressional Budget Office, households paid an additional$1,277 annuallydue to tariff-related price increases. This burden was exacerbated during the first 12 months, as retailers and suppliers navigated hard negotiations and restructuring
. For many families, this translated into difficult decisions, especially for essential but price-sensitive goods.Sector-Specific Price ImpactsThe chart“Log Import Prices (Inclusive of Tariffs)”provides a visual representation of the short-term challenges:Consumer Goods: Elasticity coefficients quickly climbed to1.0, signaling that nearly all tariff costs were passed to buyers during the early months.Furniture: Tariffs caused a steep increase in import prices, leading to significant short-term cost burdens
leading to significant short-term cost burdens before supply chain adjustments stabilized the situation.Apparel and Footwear: With heavy reliance on Chinese imports, these sectors felt immediate impacts, forcing retailers to scramble for alternative sourcing and renegotiated contracts.The attachedFigure: Log Import Prices (Inclusive of Tariffs)tells a compelling story of how tariffs affected pricing across sectors.Note:This chart illustrates how tariffs impacted import prices across various categories over
import prices across various categories over time
. The x-axis represents months relative to the imposition of tariffs (0 = tariff implementation). A coefficient of 1.0 on the y-axis indicates that the full tariff cost was passed to buyers.Where Economic Theories on Tariffs FailedThe application of traditional economic theories during the 2018–2019 tariff era highlighted significant shortcomings. These failures provide valuable lessons for navigating the current situation:1
. Exporter Absorption MisconceptionEconomic models assumed that exporters would absorb a portion of tariff costs to remain competitive in the U.S. market. However, data from theNBERshowed that foreign exporters absorbed less than10% of these costs, particularly in the first 12 months.Initially, U.S. importers bore the brunt of the tariffs, passing costs on to consumers
. Over time, hard negotiations with suppliers helped shift some of these costs back to exporters, but the process was slow and uneven across sectors.2. Ignoring Supply Chain RealitiesEconomic models often overlook the complexities of modern supply chains:High Dependency: Many U.S
. retailers relied heavily on Chinese manufacturing and lacked immediate alternatives.Costly Transitions: Transitioning to other suppliers—like Vietnam or Mexico—incurred high costs, delays, and inconsistent product quality.Time Constraints: Supply chain shifts took months, leaving retailers exposed to high costs during the short term.3. Misjudging Price ElasticitySome theoretical models also underestimated demand elasticity in certain retail sectors
. For instance:Inelastic Goods: Essentials such as basic apparel, and household necessities (e.g., cleaning products, and supplies) experienced minimal demand changes despite price increases.Elastic Goods: Categories like fashion apparel and electronics saw sharper revenue declines due to higher price sensitivity among consumers.These misjudgments highlight the importance of sector-specific strategies rather than broad economic assumptions.4
. Oversimplified Consumer BehaviorEconomic theories often treat consumers as rational actors. In reality, consumer behavior is far more nuanced. For example, instead of substituting imported goods for domestic alternatives, many consumers reduced overall spending, amplifying revenue losses for retailers.Panic buying and shifts in consumer priorities created additional challenges for sectors reliant on discretionary spending
. By recognizing these failures, retailers can adopt more practical approaches rooted in real-world complexities, ensuring better preparedness for future tariff challenges.Why This Time Could Be WorseThe current economic and geopolitical environment makes the return of tariffs potentially more disruptive than in previous years. Key factors amplifying the risks include:1. Fragile Global Supply ChainsThe pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in global supply chains
. Manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam and India once considered alternatives to China, are still recovering from disruptions. Adding tariffs to this equation could lead to severe bottlenecks, delayed shipments, and increased costs.2. Persistent InflationWhile inflation has moderated, it remains a critical issue. Higher tariffs on consumer goods could reignite inflationary pressures, particularly in price-sensitive categories such as groceries and apparel
. This could further erode disposable income and curtail spending.3. Rising Consumer DebtConsumers are already stretched thin with rising credit card balances and higher interest rates. Adding tariff-induced price hikes could reduce demand across discretionary categories, such as electronics and home goods.4. Geopolitical InstabilityTariffs are no longer confined to U.S.-China relations
. Trade tensions with allies such as Canada, Mexico, and the European Union could escalate, further complicating global trade. This increased uncertainty may dissuade retailers from making long-term investments in alternative sourcing.The convergence of these factors means that this tariff era could result in deeper and more sustained impacts
. Retailers must act decisively, leveraging insights from past experiences while adapting to new economic realities.Scenario Predictions for RetailersThe resurgence of tariffs will impact retailers differently depending on their strategies and market positioning. Here are the potential scenarios:1. Minimal ImpactRetailers who proactively diversify supply chains, optimize pricing strategies, and leverage predictive analytics may experience only marginal disruptions
. Strong consumer loyalty could further cushion the blow.2. Moderate ImpactRetailers reliant on imported goods may face profit compression as tariffs increase input costs. Strategic pricing adjustments and targeted promotions could mitigate some revenue loss.3. Severe ImpactRetailers heavily dependent on discretionary spending could see steep revenue declines
. Inflationary pressures combined with weakened consumer confidence may lead to widespread inventory challenges and demand shocks.These scenarios underscore the importance of preparedness. Retailers must adopt forward-looking strategies to minimize risks and safeguard profitability.How Retailers Can Navigate the Tariff EraNavigating the complexities of tariffs requires both immediate action and long-term planning
. Here’s how retailers can stay resilient:Short-Term StrategiesDynamic Pricing ModelsAnalyze price elasticity at SKU and category levels to determine optimal price points. Strategic price increases on inelastic goods can protect margins, while discounts on elastic items can sustain demand.Promotional TacticsPromotions and bundling strategies can offset higher prices and maintain customer engagement
. Targeted discounts on high-demand products can help clear inventory without eroding brand value.Supplier NegotiationsEngage suppliers to share tariff burdens. This might include securing temporary discounts, renegotiating contracts, or diversifying sourcing agreements.Inventory OptimizationFocus on high-margin categories and reduce stock levels for items with low price elasticity
. Implementing real-time inventory tracking ensures efficient resource allocation.Long-Term StrategiesDiversify Supply ChainsReducing dependence on a single market, such as China, is critical. Nearshoring to countries like Mexico or reshoring certain production lines can mitigate risks and reduce logistical costs.Invest in Predictive AnalyticsLeverage advanced analytics to forecast demand shifts and evaluate the long-term impact of tariffs
. Predictive tools can help retailers fine-tune pricing and inventory strategies dynamically.Enhance Customer Loyalty ProgramsLoyal customers are less price-sensitive.

Sector-Specific Price Impacts The chart“Log Import Prices (Inclusive of Tariffs)”provides a visual representation of the short-term challenges: The attachedFigure: Log Import Prices (Inclusive of Tariffs)tells a compelling story of how tariffs affected pricing across sectors. Note:This chart illustrates how tariffs impacted import prices across various categories over time. The x-axis represents months relative to the imposition of tariffs (0 = tariff implementation)
. A coefficient of 1.0 on the y-axis indicates that the full tariff cost was passed to buyers. Where Economic Theories on Tariffs Failed The application of traditional economic theories during the 2018–2019 tariff era highlighted significant shortcomings. These failures provide valuable lessons for navigating the current situation: 1. Exporter Absorption Misconception Economic models assumed that exporters would absorb a portion of tariff costs to remain competitive in the U.S. market
. market. However, data from theNBERshowed that foreign exporters absorbed less than10% of these costs, particularly in the first 12 months. 2. Ignoring Supply Chain Realities Economic models often overlook the complexities of modern supply chains: 3. Misjudging Price Elasticity Some theoretical models also underestimated demand elasticity in certain retail sectors. For instance: These misjudgments highlight the importance of sector-specific strategies rather than broad economic assumptions. 4
. 4. Oversimplified Consumer Behavior Economic theories often treat consumers as rational actors. In reality, consumer behavior is far more nuanced. For example, instead of substituting imported goods for domestic alternatives, many consumers reduced overall spending, amplifying revenue losses for retailers. Panic buying and shifts in consumer priorities created additional challenges for sectors reliant on discretionary spending
. By recognizing these failures, retailers can adopt more practical approaches rooted in real-world complexities, ensuring better preparedness for future tariff challenges. Why This Time Could Be Worse The current economic and geopolitical environment makes the return of tariffs potentially more disruptive than in previous years. Key factors amplifying the risks include: 1. Fragile Global Supply Chains The pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in global supply chains
. Manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam and India once considered alternatives to China, are still recovering from disruptions. Adding tariffs to this equation could lead to severe bottlenecks, delayed shipments, and increased costs. 2. Persistent Inflation While inflation has moderated, it remains a critical issue. Higher tariffs on consumer goods could reignite inflationary pressures, particularly in price-sensitive categories such as groceries and apparel
. This could further erode disposable income and curtail spending. 3. Rising Consumer Debt Consumers are already stretched thin with rising credit card balances and higher interest rates. Adding tariff-induced price hikes could reduce demand across discretionary categories, such as electronics and home goods. 4. Geopolitical Instability Tariffs are no longer confined to U.S.-China relations
. Trade tensions with allies such as Canada, Mexico, and the European Union could escalate, further complicating global trade. This increased uncertainty may dissuade retailers from making long-term investments in alternative sourcing. The convergence of these factors means that this tariff era could result in deeper and more sustained impacts. Retailers must act decisively, leveraging insights from past experiences while adapting to new economic realities
. Scenario Predictions for Retailers The resurgence of tariffs will impact retailers differently depending on their strategies and market positioning. Here are the potential scenarios: 1. Minimal Impact Retailers who proactively diversify supply chains, optimize pricing strategies, and leverage predictive analytics may experience only marginal disruptions. Strong consumer loyalty could further cushion the blow. 2
. 2. Moderate Impact Retailers reliant on imported goods may face profit compression as tariffs increase input costs. Strategic pricing adjustments and targeted promotions could mitigate some revenue loss. 3. Severe Impact Retailers heavily dependent on discretionary spending could see steep revenue declines. Inflationary pressures combined with weakened consumer confidence may lead to widespread inventory challenges and demand shocks. These scenarios underscore the importance of preparedness
. Retailers must adopt forward-looking strategies to minimize risks and safeguard profitability. How Retailers Can Navigate the Tariff Era Navigating the complexities of tariffs requires both immediate action and long-term planning

Smart Retail Pricing: Enhancing Strategies with Data-driven Software Retail price optimization softwareis vital for retailers seeking to maximize sales, margins, and profit, as well as consumer satisfaction and loyalty.Strategies Enabled by Retail Price Optimization SoftwareStrategy 1: Dynamic PricingDynamic pricing is a versatile approach used by retailers to modify prices in real time based on multiple factors including demand, competition, and seasonality
. Dynamic pricing enables shops to optimize their prices to align with market situations, so they stay competitive and capture the maximum margin possible.Strategy 2: Value-Based PricingThis pricing method entails comparing the perceived benefits, quality, and unique selling propositions of products and aligning prices accordingly
. Implementing this strategy encourages customers to perceive the services and products as worth the investment, which increases their willingness to pay for them.Strategy 3: Psychological PricingA cent less than a hundred appears engaging to the customer. That’s what psychological pricing strategies do: They capitalize on human psychology and perception to persuade shopping choices. For instance, setting prices at $99.99 rather than $100 creates a sense of value and affordability
. The same goes for package pricing. The value notion drives sales.Strategy 4: Penetration PricingWhen a retailer plans to enter a brand-new marketplace, it normally sets aggressive initial pricing for the merchandise it sells. Offering introductory lower fees helps stores and brands attract price-sensitive consumers and build a client base with products that offer amazing value
. Such a pricing approach, however, needs to be viewed from a long-term perspective with profitability in mind.Strategy 5: Premium PricingRetailers use premium pricing when they want to position a product as exclusive or luxurious.

6 Steps to Optimize Allocation and Drive Profitability during an Economic Slowdown The fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant economic slump in 2022. Prices for some common commodities are reaching record levels, retail sales are softening, overall economic growth is slowing, and general inflation is rising
. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the annualinflation rate increased by 9.1%for the 12 months ending June, the highest since 1981. With this rise in inflation,retailers face a real conundrum. On one hand, everything from the cost of raw materials to the cost of commercial retail space is increasing dramatically. At the same time, consumers are becoming more price sensitive and resistant to price increases
. As retailers look to minimize operating costs to maintain margins, inventory planning and allocation are critical steps that retailers simply cannot afford to overlook.For the past two decades, retailers have been establishing better integration between their physical and online operations, including inventory management, product information, price matching, flexible delivery options (click-and-collect, ship from stores etc.) and omnichannel customer interactions
. In fact, the growth of omnichannel retail is responsible for the evolving challenges retailers are facing, particularly in allocation and replenishment, which require proactive and integrated strategies across points of sale, responsive allocation, and timely replenishment.When we step back and look at the rapid changes in core merchandising effectiveness, coupled with the demands from an uncertain economy, we focus onsix stepsfor retailers to optimize allocations and drive profitability.Say “Goodbye” to
and drive profitability.Say “Goodbye” to traditional forecasting methods which are wrong half of the time, and get accurate forecasts to power your business.Accurate demand forecasting is one of the most powerful ways to improve just about every part of your business, starting with the ability to better allocate products to meet demand across your distribution centers and channels
. For years, the traditional forecasting algorithms have leaned very heavily on historical data. But with rapid changes in product preferences and consumption patterns, especially during this post COVID period, businesses need a more robust framework that includes factors beyond just historical data
. We typically find that using recency as well as dozens of macro exogenous inputs (like fuel prices, consumer sentiment, etc.) are necessary to accurately predict demand.Traditionally, forecasting down to the item/store/week level using legacy systems is challenging because of the sheer number of combinations requiring review and action. To optimize results, the inventory allocation effort must excel at the item store level
. The modern machine learning merchandising solutions that leading retailers are deploying help merchants and planners drill deep into product and size level granularities to predict the exact style-size combination to serve customer demand across both offline and online channels. Retailers can leverageAI-powered demand forecasting systemsfor identifying recent trends, seasonality, and other unique demand drivers by leveraging internal and external data
. Retailers that go this route generate accurate demand forecasts for all SKUs at the store, style or any hierarchy level across their entire lifecycle.Stop banging your head against the wall with manual allocation processes, and implement the right allocation software.Traditional ways of running the allocation process involve a vast number of repetitive tasks, and constantly revisiting a large portfolio of SKUs and stores manually. This is one of the least productive activities for any retailer
. An ideal allocation system should provide powerful, yet easy-to-configure automated workflows that eliminate repetitive user-system interactions.Creating and assigning complex rules must not only be easy, but also free up many hours of an allocator’s time.Advanced retail allocation softwarenot only improves ROI on end-to-end inventory planning and management through highly accurate forecasting, but also helps retailers cut inventory costs, decrease markdowns and increase margin dollars through better
and increase margin dollars through better planning and allocation optimization
. With auto-allocation functionality, the system selects products for allocation and automatically creates a set of allocation plans in the background reducing the time spent on product allocation and allowing the team the time to focus on high-value work.Focus on the things that actually need attention – by effectively managing exceptions.Exceptions are a means of reporting exceptional situations, such as problems or errors, which may occur during the allocation calculation or when finalizing the
the allocation calculation or when finalizing the allocation plans
. Exceptions can occur for business reasons (for example, insufficient available quantity in the distribution center) or for technical reasons (for example, missing parameter settings). Mismanagement of exceptions can lead to out-of-stocks that create dissatisfied customers and mark-downs that erode margins. Allocators who try to tackle exceptions manually may not be able to take timely corrective action
. In most retail settings waiting a few days just won’t cut it!With the right retail allocation software, exception filters notify the allocator about the high-priority problem areas so they can be addressed before routine activities
. Such systems must provide the ability to set up a range of constraints and business rules in accordance with the retail strategy.Stop guessing! Simulate and compare multiple allocation scenarios before finalizing.Manually generating multiple plans and comparing their effectiveness is very labor and time intensive, so most allocators simply don’t do it.. They use an approach they are comfortable with, though typically not the optimal one
. In fact, with manual observations, it is typically impossible to anticipate the different outcomes of implementing one sales plan versus another.Advanced allocation systems can test allocation strategies prior to execution using robust what-if analysis. They havefunctionalities to model different rules and parametersand generate alternative sales and stock plans within the tool
. For agile decision-making, the store plans must be calculated at the click of a button so that multiple versions can be easily compared and the best option for driving allocation and replenishment processes identified.Defend your turns by expediting the sale of slow moversMarkdown management is critical to expedite the sale of slow-moving stock during the season. Most retailers get their markdown strategy wrong and pack all their clearance messaging into just one clearance event each season
. At the end of a season, retailers usually sell off the leftover stock at much higher discounts than would have been required to make room for a new season. Retail leaders must deploy acomprehensiveend-to-end lifecycle pricing solutionwhich considers seasonal timing and sales curves, price elasticity, price-points/markdown breaks, and frequency of markdowns to develop an optimized markdown solution
. This will help retailerscreate careful clearance patterns that extract the most revenue, sell through the most product, and preserve margin throughoutthe season.Proactively manage in-store returns from Omnichannel sales.The adoption of omnichannel commerce has increased the complexity of returns as customers who buy online often prefer to return the goods offline at your brick-and-mortar stores
. Retailers, therefore, have to facilitate easy return management by putting in place quality checks and product sorting right at the store level, or at a nearby fulfillment center. Finally, in some cases, they are required to accommodate speedy reverse logistics to the warehouse so that the merchandise can be made available for resale as soon as possible
. This is complicated and requires having powerful MFP tools in place to make this work seamlessly.——————————————-——————————————-Given the current retail climate, retailers must grab every opportunity they can, to drive profitability. Unsold inventory is one of the main causes of both margin pressure and waste. Optimizing inventory allocation processes is an important part of helping retailers minimize such avoidable costs
. And by rationalizing their decision processes, retailers will also benefit from the increased sales that will result from achieving higher levels of availability and faster turns across channels.How can Impact Analytics help?IA’s robust predictive analytics can take into account millions of data points across myriad variables such as seasonality, trends, inflationary pressures, price elasticity, supply chain challenges, customer demand patterns, and many more, to provide actionable insights around

. Instead of waiting for a store to run out of stock, AI-powered systems enable real-time adjustments, optimizing inventory across the entire network.For example, AI and ML can predict shifts in demand based on external factors like weather or local events, ensuring inventory is moved before it’s too late. Imagine a sudden increase in demand for jackets due to a local weather event
. AI can trigger an automatic transfer from a nearby store, ensuring customers find what they need.AI also enables better inventory forecasting by considering consumer behavior patterns, sales history, and local trends, ensuring no product sits idle in a low-demand store while another store faces a shortage.Benefits of AI-Driven Store TransfersAI-powered store-to-store transfers bring several game-changing benefits to retail operations
. These advantages touch everything from sales performance to cost management. Let’s explore how this transformative approach can reshape your retail processes.A. Higher Sell-Through RatesOne of the key benefits of AI-driven store transfers is the ability to boost sell-through rates. When stock is redistributed according to demand, retailers can ensure popular products are always available in high-demand locations
. This means customers are more likely to purchase the items they want, leading to a higher sales volume. With AI’s ability to predict demand at a granular level, transfers can be optimized for timing and location, reducing the chances of unsold stock accumulating in low-performing stores.The result? A reduction in markdowns, as products are sold at full price. This directly impacts profit margins, making the whole operation more profitable

For example, transferring excess stock of a popular item from a slow store to one with higher traffic ensures that products sell faster, keeping inventory fresh and reducing the need for costly discounts.AI-driven store transfers also allow retailers to react in real time to shifts in demand. The faster and smarter you can transfer stock, the more you’ll optimize your product offerings and improve sell-through rates.B
. Reduced Stockouts and Excess Inventory (To Be Added)The balance between overstock and stockouts is delicate. But with AI-powered demand forecasting, this balance is much easier to maintain. AI systems continuously analyze inventory levels, sales trends, and forecasts to predict demand patterns and help prevent stockouts and reduce excess inventory across all stores.Stockouts can lead to lost sales and frustrated customers
. Nobody wants to hear, “Sorry, we’re out of stock.” By accurately forecasting demand, the system can predict when an item is likely to run out, allowing for timely store transfers from locations with excess inventory.On the flip side, excess inventory ties up valuable shelf space and storage. By using AI-powered demand forecasting, retailers can predict which stores will have slower sales of certain items and trigger transfers before overstock becomes a problem
. The system ensures that products are redistributed efficiently, avoiding both shortages and surplus. This results in improved inventory flow, reduced holding costs, and a more streamlined supply chain.C. Improved Customer ExperienceCustomers expect instant availability. If they can’t find the product they want, they’ll simply go elsewhere. AI-driven store transfers ensure that customers’ needs are met by proactively moving inventory to stores where demand is rising
. When customers find the products they want, at the store they prefer, their satisfaction increases significantly.This level of optimization improves not only the customer’s experience but also their loyalty. If your store consistently has the right products in stock, customers are more likely to return
. This is especially important in a world where competition is fierce and customers can easily jump between retailers.AI’s ability to forecast and react quickly to customer demand patterns helps ensure that products are always available when customers need them most. Whether it’s a sudden uptick in demand for a seasonal product or the need to restock after a local event, AI ensures that inventory moves seamlessly to meet customer expectations.D
. Cost Savings (To Be Added)Effective store-to-store transfers can offer significant cost savings, particularly for retailers that do not rely on a centralized warehouse or for specific product categories
. While distributing from a central warehouse (1-to-many) is generally more cost-effective due to existing distribution center (DC) infrastructure and labor, store-to-store transfers become essential for businesses that ship directly from designers or suppliers to stores, such as high-end designer retailers.In such cases, AI-powered store-to-store transfers optimize inventory management by redistributing excess stock from stores with lower demand to those with higher demand
. This helps prevent overstock situations and reduces the need for markdowns. By ensuring that the right products are in the right place at the right time, AI minimizes excess inventory, frees up valuable store space, and prevents the need for drastic markdown strategies.Additionally, AI automates the inventory distribution process, eliminating the need for manual decision-making and reducing labor costs
. While store-to-store transfers may involve non-specialized store labor and smaller parcel shipments, the use of AI optimizes these processes, reducing inefficiencies and manual effort
. This allows teams to focus on higher-value tasks such as strategy development and customer engagement.Ultimately, AI-driven store-to-store transfers provide a powerful lever for maximizing stock efficiency, avoiding markdowns, and enhancing overall profitability, especially for retailers without centralized warehouses or with highly localized inventory needs.Key AI and ML Capabilities for Effective Inventory Transfers1
. Inventory Allocation Logic (To Be Added)AI and ML are what make these store-to-store transfers truly transformative. Let’s dive into the specific capabilities these technologies bring to the table.For store transfers, clustering is not a requirement. Instead, store transfers follow the eligibility logic defined during upstream assortment planning, which incorporates various factors like product demand, store characteristics, and regional preferences
. This ensures that transfers align with the overall inventory strategy without the need for additional clustering steps.During the assortment phase, stores are grouped based on demand patterns and specific attributes, which helps to define initial allocations. Once this framework is in place, store transfers operate within these predefined boundaries, ensuring inventory is moved efficiently and aligns with the store’s needs
. For example, if an area is identified as requiring more winter apparel, store transfers will be guided by this eligibility logic, rather than clustering each store for every transfer.This approach streamlines the process by reducing unnecessary steps while maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the overall inventory management system.2. Scenario SimulationOne of the most powerful features of machine learning in the context of store transfers is the ability to simulate multiple scenarios
. AI systems can test different transfer strategies and predict their impact on key metrics like sell-through rates, cost savings, and inventory turnover.For instance, a retailer might ask: “What would happen if I moved 200 units of product A from store X to store Y?” AI can simulate the transfer, factoring in variables like expected sales, potential shipping delays, and how long it would take for the products to reach their new home.This ability to simulate and compare different strategies before executing
and compare different strategies before executing them ensures that retailers make the optimal decision
. Retailers can evaluate potential risks, rewards, and costs, allowing them to proceed with confidence and avoid costly mistakes.3. Exception-Based ManagementAI systems can highlight exceptions—events that fall outside the normal patterns, such as a sudden spike in demand or unexpected excess inventory
. These exceptions are flagged in real time, allowing retailers to act quickly and make adjustments as needed.For example, if a particular store suddenly experiences a surge in demand for a specific item, AI systems will detect this anomaly and recommend an immediate transfer from another store or warehouse
. Similarly, if a store is left with a large quantity of unsold products that aren’t moving, AI will suggest transferring those items to a store with higher sales potential.This proactive approach to exception management ensures smoother operations and helps retailers avoid potential losses or missed opportunities.4. Continuous LearningAI and ML algorithms learn and improve over time
. It processes more data and analyzes outcomes, it refines its algorithms to make better decisions in the future.For example, if a transfer recommendation doesn’t achieve the expected results, the system learns from this and adjusts its approach for future transfers

. Delays or inaccuracies from suppliers disrupt your supply chain. This can lead to stockouts or excess inventory. Building strong relationships with reliable suppliers mitigates this risk. Communicate regularly to ensure timely deliveries. Have backup suppliers to handle unexpected disruptions. Negotiate favorable terms to secure better prices and flexible delivery options. 5. Overstocking and Stockouts Overstockingties up capital and increases holding costs
. On the other hand, stockouts result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. Balancing inventory levels is essential. Useinventory management systemsto track stock levels in real time. Set reorder points and safety stock levels to maintain optimal inventory. Regularly review your inventory policies to adjust to changes in demand and supply chain dynamics. 6. Technological Challenges Implementing new inventory management systems can be challenging. Training your staff to use these systems is essential
. Ensure everyone understands the benefits and functionalities. Regular updates and maintenance keep your systems running smoothly. Choosing the right technology that fits your business needs is crucial. Evaluate different options before investing in a solution. 7. Cost Management Managing inventory costs is a constant challenge. Holding costs, ordering costs, and shortage costs need careful balancing. Implement strategies to minimize these costs. Use the just-in-time inventory to reduce holding costs
. Negotiate bulk discounts with suppliers to lower ordering costs. Maintain safety stock to prevent shortages. Regularly analyze your cost structure to identify areas for improvement. 8. Inventory Accuracy Maintaining accurate inventory records is essential. Inaccuracies lead to poor decision-making. Regular audits and cycle counts ensure your records match actual stock. Use technology to automate data entry and reduce errors. Training your staff on best practices improves accuracy
. 💡FactDid you know that74%of businesses have faced significant disruptions, including delayed shipments and substantially extended lead times? Inventory Control Methods Inventory control involves various methods suited to different business needs. Each type of inventory control offers unique benefits. Here are some common types and examples: 1. Consignment Inventory Consignment inventory involves holding stock that remains the supplier’s property until sold
. This arrangement reduces your holding costs and improves cash flow. You only pay for inventory after it sells. Retailers often use consignment for new or seasonal items. Suppliers assume the risk of unsold stock. This method can strengthen relationships with suppliers. 2. Perpetual Inventory Systems Perpetual inventory control systems continuously monitor inventory levels. They provide real-time updates on stock movements. This system allows immediate adjustments and accurate tracking
. Retailers like Walmart use perpetual systems to manage large inventories efficiently. This method reduces manual errors and improves overall accuracy. 3. Periodic Inventory Systems Periodic inventory systems require regular physical counts to update records. Although less automated, this method helps verify the accuracy of your inventory. It identifies discrepancies between records and actual stock. Small businesses often use periodic systems due to lower costs
. Regular counts ensure your records are accurate. 4. Barcode and RFID Technology Barcode and RFID technology streamline inventory management. Barcodes allow for quick and accurate data entry. RFID tags offer real-time tracking of inventory movements. Companies like Amazon use RFID to enhance warehouse efficiency. These technologies minimize errors and boost operational efficiency. 5. Safety Stock Safety stock involves keeping a buffer of inventory
. It protects against unexpected demand spikes and supply chain disruptions. Proper safety stock levels ensure you can meet customer needs even during unforeseen events. Calculating safety stock requires analyzing demand variability and lead times. This extra inventory acts as a cushion against uncertainties. Examples of Inventory Control 1. Grocery Store A grocery store uses safety stock to avoid running out of popular items like milk and bread
. They use barcodes to quickly scan products and update inventory levels. The store performs periodic checks to ensure that records match the actual stock on shelves. 2. E-commerce Warehouse An e-commerce warehouse uses a perpetual inventory system. It tracks inventory in real-time as products are sold and restocked. RFID technology helps monitor the movement of goods, ensuring accuracy and reducing errors. 3. Clothing Retailer A clothing retailer applies ABC analysis to manage its stock
. High-value items like designer clothes are closely monitored (A-items). Moderate and low-value items, like basic t-shirts, are managed with less frequent checks (B- and C-items). This approach helps prioritize resources effectively. 4. Manufacturer A manufacturer uses Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory to keep minimal stock on hand. Parts and materials are delivered exactly when needed for production. This method reduces storage costs and minimizes waste. 5
. 5. Bookstore A bookstore usesdemand forecastingto predict which books will be popular. This helps them stock up on bestsellers while avoiding overstocking less popular titles. They also use a periodic inventory system to verify the accuracy of their stock records. Inventory Control Techniques Several techniques enhance inventory control. These methods help maintain optimal stock levels and improve efficiency. Here are some effective inventory control techniques: 1
. Inventory Audits Regular inventory tracking verifies the accuracy of your inventory records. They identify discrepancies between records and actual stock. Conducting audits periodically ensures that your inventory records remain accurate. This practice helps catch issues early, maintain accuracy, and prevent losses. 2. Demand Forecasting Demand forecasting techniquesanalyze historical sales data and market trends. Accurate forecasting helps maintain optimal inventory levels
. It reduces the risk of stockouts or excess inventory. Businesses use forecasting tools to predict future demand. This method involves statistical analysis and market research. Effective forecasting improves inventory planning and management. 3. Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory Management Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory managementinvolves keeping minimal inventory on hand. Stock is replenished only when needed. This approach reduces holding costs. It requires precise demand forecasting to avoid stockouts
. Businesses use JIT to minimize waste and increase efficiency. For JIT to work, reliable suppliers and a responsive supply chain are essential. 4. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)calculates the optimal order quantity to minimize total inventory costs. EOQ considers holding, ordering, and shortage costs. It helps determine the most cost-effective order size. Businesses use EOQ to balance ordering frequency and stock levels
. This method ensures that you do not overstock or understock. Implementing EOQ requires accurate data on demand and costs. 5. Cycle Counting Cycle counting involves counting a portion of the inventory regularly rather than doing a full inventory count. This method helps maintain continuous accuracy. It allows you to spot and fix errors promptly. Businesses use cycle counting to reduce the disruption of operations and ensure ongoing inventory accuracy. 6
. 6. Two-Bin System The two-bin system uses two bins to manage inventory. When the first bin is empty, it signals the need to reorder. The second bin provides stock until the new order arrives. This simple method helps ensure continuous supply. It is commonly used for small parts and office supplies. The two-bin system is easy to implement and manage. 7.

With 9% Inflation, How do you Price? Thanksgiving is around the corner and the headlines out of Wall Street are not pretty
. Inflation is now consistently hovering around8.5-9%, interest rates are rising by 75 bps andone can realistically expect this difficult environment to continue and the challenges to flow from Wall Street to Main Street.Pricing, be it for retailers or grocers, is incredibly difficult during normal times, and becomes all the more so given the current circumstances, requiring a more thoughtful and nuanced approach. Business-as-usual is the last strategy merchants should rely on
. The good news is that there are time-tested strategies that pricing teams can focus on. Before we get to those, let us look at some things that definitely should not be done while creating pricing strategies:Creating pricing strategies that rely on last year’s numbersNeedless to say, with COVID-19, this strategy has been at least partially unseated. Nonetheless, it is still being used by planners, albeit with FY 2019 as base year. We tend to fall back on our habits and this is a not-so-great one
. Strategies such as looking into historicals or relying on last week’s rate of sale for example, have worked directionally in normal times, but are going to fall short as consumers look for deals in the current milieu. And by not optimizing pricing strategies, planners leave significant dollars on the table.The ‘new normal’ and the ensuing assumptionsWe have established that relying on historical numbers is not good enough to make pricing decisions anymore
. The other end of this spectrum is guesswork arising from either exhaustion or biases.✅ ‘Let’s go with a 30% discount like last year.’ –> Classic example of decision fatigue!✅‘Shipping costs have increased by 12%, let’s increase correspondingly.’ –> Classic example of accounting for just 1 variable!✅ ‘I feel 50% is the new 30% in this economy.’ –> Assumptions based on individual experiences or local knowledge that might not apply to all stores /or across regions.The excuse for underperformance – ‘I know

Markdown optimization is hard, and given the macro factors, judgment calls get much harder even for an experienced planner. Automating and systematizing these decisions using a robust AI driven process always (ALWAYS) leads to better outcomes.Setting up weekly targets, instead of focusing on lifecycle optimizationThis is a common mistake
. Planners want to hit their KPI targets. Let’s say the target hovers around ~75% sell through during the regular sales period. To achieve this sell through over the season, planners use simple heuristics such as 6% ST a week, hoping during a 13-week sales period it will reach around 75-78% ST. This is a suboptimal strategy as some weeks need not hit 6% and in some weeks, 6% sell through means that the products are underperforming
. For example, a fashion style color may sell 4% during off season and usually sells >10% during the Thanksgiving week. The 6% sell through a week strategy completely misses this and results in less margin $. The reason why planners keep relying on this weekly heuristic is simple; it is virtually impossible to keep the seasonality component in mind while using anExcelsheet

You can’t control inflation, but you can proactively price to win in any environment During the last 18 months, consumer inflation accelerated in most developed and emerging economies. In the United States, theconsumer price index (CPI)rose from 2.6% in March 2021 to 9.1% in June 2022, the fastest in 40 years, before showing a declining trend. In the European Union, consumer inflation reached10%in September 2022, its highest-ever level and is expected to rise further
. With the uptick in interest rates and as consumer buying power lessens, many retailers may begin seeing a pullback in demand, only to create a greater need to rigorously respond to inflation.There’s no denying the current retail models are stressed and the challenges for retailers are bound to increase as consumers become highly price-conscious and adjust their shopping behavior. It is more important now than ever for retailers to find ways to overcome these challenges to survive
. Today’s retail environment, with its inflationary pressures and post-COVID economic recovery, makes it imperative for brands to take into consideration many additional factors that could contribute to shopping behavior patterns – purchasing power, price elasticity, competitor pricing, and unemployment, to name a few! Pricing proactively can not only play a significant role in surviving the changing customer behavior, but can also enable retailers to prepare for any other external factors leading to an
for any other external factors leading to an economic downturn.Let’s take a look at six areas of focus to proactively price and win in the near term:Get more mileage out of each promo dollarHeading into what looks like a very intense promotional period, retailers must promote smarter and revisit category strategies to reflect shifts in consumer purchase behaviors and margin profiles
. Evaluating which product categories will face the most inflationary pressures that are likely to yield significant changes in consumer behavior will help retailers make informed category-strategy decisions to turn this to their advantage.Additionally, a comprehensiveend-to-end lifecycle pricing solutioncan help retailers with their retail price optimization, promotion, and markdown optimization needs
. They can carefully manage end-dates and store capacity, to create careful clearance patterns that extract the most revenue, sell through the most product, and preserve margin throughout, while keeping customers satisfied with the value they receive. Business strategies often require quick shifts with the changing business environment, such as focusing on sell-through in one instance, while at other times maximizing margin goals
. Having a target-based pricing strategy can help retailers not only tackle inflation, but also other external factors that can affect sales.Adopt new customer buying patterns to boost your Average Transaction Value (ATV)Post-pandemic a change has been observed in the buying pattern of customers. Most retailers assume their baskets will shrink in tough economic times, but this does not have to be the case
. Customers now prefer larger basket sizes to avoid frequent visits to the stores not only due to pandemic fears but also to save on increasing gas prices. Online traffic has increased multifold. These ever-changing buying patterns need to be taken into account to come up with a better pricing strategy which fits the changing economic environment
. Retailers canleverage AI-powered demand forecastingfor capturing buying patterns, trends, seasonality, and other unique demand drivers, all in one place.Understand the price elasticity of your portfolioPrice elasticity is the key when it comes to increasing prices. For some products, it is very easy to increase the price without affecting the sales quantity, but this might not hold true for the entire portfolio
. Sales for many products will decline if the price rises significantly as customers will switch to alternatives or turn to the competition. Therefore, It is extremely important to understand the nature of elasticity for products prior to finalizing the pricing strategy.Inflation price calculator is a simple tool that helps in determining the ideal change in product price required to maintain the margins at the same level
. It requires the following inputs:Product’s elasticityCurrent price of the productCost of the productAverage promotion % currently appliedInflation growth percentageThe calculator uses the above listed inputs to recommend a percentage change in price to maintain the same margins
. This calculator is very helpful for retailers in deciding the price increase/ decrease by considering the most critical factors that can affect sales margin.For instance, if a highly elastic product that costs $5, is priced at $20 and sells at a 50% discount, reducing the price will be the ideal pricing strategy instead of increasing the price to maintain the same margins during rising inflation.Inflation Pricing CalculatorCurrent MSRP ($)Current COGS ($)ElasticityInelasticModerately InelasticUnit

. Best-in-class companies and brands rely on advanced retail analytics for pricing recommendations. Modern pricing tools examine customers’ willingness to pay, and the margin performance expected from the price change
. Considering customers’ willingness to pay and product differentiation when making pricing decisions can help companies make more thoughtful pricing decisions in the present, as well as when we pass the current inflationary period.And no matter what, even in what seem like intensely competitive times, retailers must avoid strict competitor-based pricing. Just because your competition does it, does not mean it is right for your business
. Consumers are notoriously attentive to the pricing of certain products and categories. But in other cases retailers have the opportunity to price more freely; being aggressive where it matters, and backing off where it does not
. It is also important to deploy smart communication strategies emphasizing product attributes that justify higher prices, such as superior quality, innovation, and exclusivity.Go granular with pricing and promotion to deliver value to the customerImplementing broad price increases in response to inflation is bad for both consumers and retailers and may erode customer trust
. Rather, retailers should tailor their inflationary price response by customer and product segment, considering both margin performance and the consumers’ willingness to pay. Retailers that take a strategic and granular approach are more likely to emerge more profitable and with their consumer loyalty intact
. What’s more, retailers should re-evaluate their price and promotion mix during this time and pull back on promotions, which can help manage cost increases without raising prices.Additionally, retailers can be well prepared for any external shocks by leveraging data-driven analytics tools to track price changes, customer feedback, competitor moves, and other key metrics relevant to their business
. AnAI-powered test platformcan empower retailers with rapid and easy test set-up, better statistical test and learn methodology, richer deep dives to understand outcomes, and most importantly better decisions and improved business performance.Eliminate low-margin products that are not traffic driversAs mentioned earlier, incorporating retail analytics solutions can help retailers easily track key metrics like gross profit margin on individual products
. Despite how simple this may sound, many retailers do not have the end-to-end visibility into their business systems to accurately allocate costs to product-level P&Ls, blinding them to where they actually make money
. By minimizing or altogether eliminating products with the lowest profit margins from their stock, especially those that are not effective traffic drivers, retailers can focus their time, energy and money on products that yield higher returns.How can Impact Analytics help?IA’s robust predictive analytics can take into account millions of data points across myriad variables such as seasonality, trends, inflationary pressures, price elasticity, supply chain challenges, customer demand patterns, and many

. During the last 18 months, consumer inflation accelerated in most developed and emerging economies. In the United States, theconsumer price index (CPI)rose from 2.6% in March 2021 to 9.1% in June 2022, the fastest in 40 years, before showing a declining trend. In the European Union, consumer inflation reached10%in September 2022, its highest-ever level and is expected to rise further
. With the uptick in interest rates and as consumer buying power lessens, many retailers may begin seeing a pullback in demand, only to create a greater need to rigorously respond to inflation. There’s no denying the current retail models are stressed and the challenges for retailers are bound to increase as consumers become highly price-conscious and adjust their shopping behavior. It is more important now than ever for retailers to find ways to overcome these challenges to survive
. Today’s retail environment, with its inflationary pressures and post-COVID economic recovery, makes it imperative for brands to take into consideration many additional factors that could contribute to shopping behavior patterns – purchasing power, price elasticity, competitor pricing, and unemployment, to name a few! Pricing proactively can not only play a significant role in surviving the changing customer behavior, but can also enable retailers to prepare for any other external factors leading to an
for any other external factors leading to an economic downturn
. Let’s take a look at six areas of focus to proactively price and win in the near term: Get more mileage out of each promo dollar Heading into what looks like a very intense promotional period, retailers must promote smarter and revisit category strategies to reflect shifts in consumer purchase behaviors and margin profiles
. Evaluating which product categories will face the most inflationary pressures that are likely to yield significant changes in consumer behavior will help retailers make informed category-strategy decisions to turn this to their advantage. Additionally, a comprehensiveend-to-end lifecycle pricing solutioncan help retailers with their retail price optimization, promotion, and markdown optimization needs
. They can carefully manage end-dates and store capacity, to create careful clearance patterns that extract the most revenue, sell through the most product, and preserve margin throughout, while keeping customers satisfied with the value they receive. Business strategies often require quick shifts with the changing business environment, such as focusing on sell-through in one instance, while at other times maximizing margin goals
. Having a target-based pricing strategy can help retailers not only tackle inflation, but also other external factors that can affect sales. Adopt new customer buying patterns to boost your Average Transaction Value (ATV) Post-pandemic a change has been observed in the buying pattern of customers. Most retailers assume their baskets will shrink in tough economic times, but this does not have to be the case
. Customers now prefer larger basket sizes to avoid frequent visits to the stores not only due to pandemic fears but also to save on increasing gas prices. Online traffic has increased multifold. These ever-changing buying patterns need to be taken into account to come up with a better pricing strategy which fits the changing economic environment. Retailers canleverage AI-powered demand forecastingfor capturing buying patterns, trends, seasonality, and other unique demand drivers, all in one place
. Understand the price elasticity of your portfolio Price elasticity is the key when it comes to increasing prices. For some products, it is very easy to increase the price without affecting the sales quantity, but this might not hold true for the entire portfolio. Sales for many products will decline if the price rises significantly as customers will switch to alternatives or turn to the competition
. Therefore, It is extremely important to understand the nature of elasticity for products prior to finalizing the pricing strategy. Inflation price calculator is a simple tool that helps in determining the ideal change in product price required to maintain the margins at the same level.

Analysis:Amazon Prime Day 2023Promotions Are a Holiday Bellwether We analyzed Amazon Prime Day promotions across 11 categories over the last five years.What we learned will help you prepare for the 2023 holiday season
. Home»Resources»Industry Analyses»Amazon Prime Day Analysis 2023 Prime Day Promotions Analysis: Why We Do It As an AI-driven retail data analytics firm, we’ve analyzed Amazon Prime Day 2023 sales to discern the causes, isolate the effects, identify the trends, predict the future—in this case, the upcoming 2023 holiday season—and ensure our clients are able to take full advantage of our learnings and evolving, real-time conditions. Prime Day Promotions Analysis: Numbers Talk. Loudly
. Loudly. The 2023 Amazon Prime Day sale was Amazon.com’s largest ever1. Over two days (July 11-12): That is a lot of shopping. Consumers, weary of inflation, were primed (as it were) for bargains and Amazon Prime Day 2023 delivered, offering more deals than any previous Prime Day
. Notably, however, the average year-over-year (YoY) order size barely budged—increasing from $52.26 to $54.05, according to Numerator market research firm3—and, based on data drawn from the Consumer Price Index, more than 80 percent of that increase was due to inflation. Numerator also notes that consumers said their top two categories were Home Goods and Home Essentials
. Taken together, Numerator’s data points indicate consumers at mid-year 2023 are still feeling constrained, especially when it comes to spending on discretionary items. Prime Day Promotions Analysis: A Mixed Bag for Consumers So what did we learn from Amazon Prime Day 2023? Promo depth for most categories—such as Smart Home (more than 40 percent), Small Appliances, Footwear, and Exercise & Fitness—was largely in line with last year’s discounts
. Essential Goods were discounted more deeply YoY while categories that suffered from excessive discounting last year corrected back to normal. As noted, discretionary spending appeared restrained due to consumer skittishness (over high inflation and interest rates, macroeconomic uncertainty, etc.). Amazon and its vendors chose to apply their deepest discounts to Household Supplies, Home Improvement, and Personal Care items—an increase between 5 to 10 percent over last year
. Base prices for the Home Improvement category increased by more than 30 percent while Household Supplies and Personal Care categories stayed mostly flat. The COVID pandemic-induced inventory glut has largely dissipated, enabling apparel discounts to revert to the mean: Apparel promo depth dropped ~40 percent compared to Prime Day 2022, albeit on very high base prices, which stayed fairly flat after their sharp, more than 20 percent increase last year
. The Impact Analytics Fashion Promotion Index, which captures the depth and breadth of promotions in Footwear, Athleisure, and Regular Wear, and is updated every two weeks, corroborates these findings: Apparel discounts have been lower this year, with Regular Wear down 12 percent. The promo depth for Amazon brands also declined from last year. Many top-selling items across categories were heavily discounted
. Amazon Prime Day 2023 and This Holiday Season Our analysis strongly suggests that, despite cooling inflation, a still-rosy employment picture, and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s fabled “soft landing” for the economy nearly in hand, consumers will continue focusing their spending on nondiscretionary items—and retailers will continue targeting those items for discounts. Of course, there’s still a lot yet to process this year
. Variables and unknowns include: All of which leaves consumers cautious and retailers uncertain. As conditions shift or utterly transform, retailers must be prepared to make quick, tactical changes to their pricing and promotions strategy.

Black Friday Promotion Analysis:Are Retailers Still Going All In? Holiday shopping was expected to stay flat or increase only marginally year over year thanks to stubborn (though much diminished) inflation and higher interest rates. Retailers have traditionally responded to similar conditions with deep discounts
. What did they do for this year’s Black Friday sales events? Home»Resources»Industry Analyses»Black Friday Promotion Analysis: Are Retailers Still Going All In? Black Friday Promotion Depth Trends 2021-2023 Average promotion depth for the Black Friday 2023 sales event was 35 percent—flat compared to last year. Smart Home, Earbuds, Clothing and Accessories, and Beauty & Personal Care products have stayed consistently among the top five most discounted categories year after year
. Dominance of Technology-Driven Categories: A slew of innovative, technologically enhanced products enter the market every year, and consumers’ love for the latest and greatest gadgetry ensures Smart Home and Earbuds categories are always heavily discounted to grab shopper attention. How Did Black Friday 2023 Compare to 2022? Black Friday 2023 discount depth changed little compared to last year The exceptions were Earbuds (up 6%), Home Improvement (down 6%), and Computers, Tablets & Laptops (down 18%)
. The steep drop in PC promo depth appears to be a regression to the mean as the category was discounted unusually heavily in 2022. The Black Friday 2023 categories with the deepest promotions included the four perennial leaders: Earbuds—This category’s average promo depth of 42 percent (up 6% from 2022) ties it with Smart Home for the most deeply discounted. Smart Home—Smart Home also sported a promo depth of 42 percent, unchanged from last year
. Beauty & Personal Care—Beauty & Personal Care promotion depth in 2023 was 39 percent, a slight increase (3%) over last year. Clothing and Accessories—Same as Beauty & Personal Care: 39 percent in 2023, a slight increase (3%) over last year
. Categories with Steepest YoY Promo Depth Increase The Earbuds category has seen a consistent increase in promo depth during Black Friday, highlighting the popularity of wireless audio technology and the diverse price points available for consumers with different budgets. Much like Earbuds, the Beauty & Personal Care category has consistently grown its promotion depth, highlighting shopper interest in self-care and grooming for themselves during the holidays as well as for gifting
. Categories with Steepest YoY Promo Depth Decline The Computers, Tablets & Laptops category registered the most dramatic YoY promo depth decline, down 17 percent from its 2022 high of 39 percent. Home Improvement, the category with the biggest increase in average promo depth during the 2023 Amazon Prime Big Deals Day sale, saw its depth of promotion dip 7 percent. (How the mighty have fallen!) Thelatest updatesindicate home repair tools underperformed, which may be attributable to the lower promotions
. How Retailers Planned Their Black Friday Sales Events Virtually all major retailers announced pre-holiday event sales in October. Amazon announced Big Deals Day, Walmart announced Walmart Deals, and Target and Best Buy made similar announcements. Retailers employed different strategies during the Black Friday sales event. Big Box Retailers—Most big box retailers started their Black Friday sales on Wednesday, November 22 and ran them for four days
. A few retailers such as Home Depot and Kroger held their sales for seven days. Fashion (Apparel, Footwear, and Beauty)—Fashion retailers planned sales to start as early as November 15 and continue as late as November 27. Most, though, limited their sales to seven days. Electronics and Appliances—Many Electronics retailers planned sales to run an average of 10 days until November 30. Apple and Samsung, however, limited their Cyber Monday sales event to just four days (November 24-27)
. Conclusion and Guidance Overall, retailers have held their Black Friday discounting steady, taking a wait-and-see approach before going deep on discounting further into the holiday shopping season. Even as consumers continue to open their wallets, they express pessimism about the economic outlook, which could lead to slower sales growth. Accordingly, retailers will have to chalk out the right promotion and markdown strategy to liquidate their inventory profitably this holiday season

The Impact Analytics Grocery Inflation Index The Impact Analytics Grocery Inflation Index tracks weekly U.S. price movements of key grocery items. We capture vast amounts of publicly available information from major grocers across multiple geographies, and because we publish more frequently than the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we generate actionable insights for our clients based on the most granular, up-to-date data available
. Home»Resources»Industry Analyses»Grocery Inflation Index Grocery claims a15.6% share of overall U.S. retail spending. It’s a high-frequency, fairly inelastic, essential category, so any pricing changes influence discretionary spending. Because we track grocery inflation so closely, we’re able to identify trends, analyze the impact, and share more accurate insights with our clients faster than other retail planning providers
. We’ve built a basket of the most consumed grocery products in the U.S., collecting from such categories as fruits and vegetables, cereals and baked goods, dairy, meat, seafood and poultry, frozen foods, deli, and beverages. We select these items based on consumer availability, accessibility, and popularity. The different categories are weighted based on their “average” U.S. consumption
. consumption. For example, if consumers spend 20 percent of their grocery budget on dairy, then 20 percent of the basket contains dairy products. We have further classified these products into macro-nutrient food groups (protein, carbohydrate, and fat contributors), staple food and discretionary food, healthy food and unhealthy food, and plant-based and nonplant-based to help uncover any underlying price trends across each of these groups
. We then compare their prices weekly to discern price inflation and its effects. Food Prices Increased Significantly Over the Past 12 Months Inflation in the overall food-at-home segment (including grocery store and supermarket food purchases) rose 0.9 percent over the last 12 months. The steepest increase was in meats, poultry, fish, and eggs (3.2 percent)
. Offsetting that over the same period, fruits and vegetables prices declined slightly (0.2 percent) and similarly cereals and bakery products declined (0.3 percent), Dairy and related products increased slightly (0.4). Other significant food categories displayed varying increases— Non Alcoholic beverages and beverage materials increased by 1.3 percent whereas, Other food at home increased by 0.4 percent
. Meats, poultry, fish, and eggs are the only category with the steepest increase among the food-at-home segment. Also, “food away from home” significantly saw an increase of 4.0 percent. Pricing Insights from Recent Weeks:Marginal Price Increases From August to September, prices rose only slightly: 1.40 percent. The steepest price increase (3.80 percent) was observed in the Non Alcoholic Beverages and beverage materials category & (2.98 percent) in Fruits & Vegetables materials
. Meats, poultry, fish & Eggs prices went up (1.51 percent) and the prices of Cereals & Bakery Products rose by (0.41 percent), along with “Other food at home” increasing by (1.71 percent). The steepest decline in the prices was observed in Dairy & Related products (2.04 percent). Discretionary, Protein-Rich, and Non-healthy Product Prices Continue Outpacing Other Segments Month-over-month (MoM) prices for discretionary food products decreased by 0.07 percent while staple products increased by 0.17 percent
. Prices for fat-rich and carbohydrates-rich products decreased by 0.17 percent and 0.07 percent, respectively whereas, protein-rich products increased by 0.84 perccent. Price increases for healthy products (0.41 percent MoM) slightly outpaced that of non-healthy products (0.21 percent). Prices for plant-based products decreased by 0.20 percent while non-plant-based product prices also rose by 0.31 percent.

IA's Insights on Pricing & Promotions -Athleisure & Footwear IA’s Pricing and Promotions Analysis identifies the trends and changes in pricing and promotions across various categories by tracking and analyzing publicly available data. The analysis provides insights about promotions at a category level and across different price points. It also uncovers the pricing strategies adopted by brands across categories as a response to the current market conditions
. Home»Resources»Industry Analyses»IA’s Insights on Pricing & Promotions – Athleisure & Footwear As Consumers become cautious about their spending habits, promotions seemed to have bottomed out: Footwear and Apparel prices increased by 4.5% and 5% respectively in May 2022 over the previous year according to the Consumer Price Index data. Due to a significant increase in the cost of living, consumers have started feeling the pinch and this is beginning to reflect in lower consumer confidence
. This may force them to spend more wisely, reduce their discretionary and impulse spends, drive migration to lower priced brands and aggressively pursue discounts. Considering the lower consumer confidence, we foresee promo intensity increasing in coming months. Retailers and brands are trying to adapt different pricing and promotional strategies to keep their products affordable for their target consumers. These strategies vary by depth and breadth across each of the subcategories
. Across Athleisure and Footwear, brands are maintaining an average discount of ~25-30% on around 30% of their product to ensure products remain affordable for consumers. For Footwear, the average discount on men's footwear is 2% to 9% lower and the promo breadth is lower by 10% to 18% (except for boots). In Athleisure, while the average discount is the same across menswear and women’s apparel, the promo breadth is higher for women’s clothing across all categories by 12% to 33%
. Brands are trying to make their merchandise affordable while maintaining their price perception Amid tumbling consumer confidence and lower affordability, brands are offering on average ~10% deeper discounts on the lowest-priced products (Quartile 1) as compared to the highest-priced products (Quartile 4). Moreover, the breadth of the promotions is by ~20% higher for products in Quartile 1 as compared to products in Quartile 4 for Footwear
. The graphs below indicate the distribution of products across quartiles based on the selling price of the item in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 respectively. The size of the bubble reflects the breadth of the promotions by products in the respective quartile
. A similar trend can be seen in Athleisure, where the average discount being offered is higher by ~3% on the lowest priced products (Quartile 1) than on the highest-priced products (Quartile 4), and the breadth of the promotions is higher by ~60% for products in Quartile 1 as compared to products in Quartile 4
. Brands are adopting different pricing/promotion strategies across key value categories to garner higher wallet share For Footwear (sub category - Athletic Shoes) while the recommended price for Brand 2 is higher by ~21% than Brand 1, it offers a deeper average discount (5%) on a broader set of products (90% for Brand 2 vs ~30% for Brand 1). Brand 4 on the other hand is providing lower than average category discounts on all of its products in certain categories
. The size of the bubble in the below graphs indicates the breadth of the promotions for the brands in the respective categories. In Athleisure, across categories, Brand 2 is providing deeper discounts on a broader range of its products as compared to other brands with a few exceptions. Conversely, Brand 4 is providing lower than average category discounts on all of its products in certain categories. Brand 5 does not offer discounts on any of their products

Amazon Prime Day Discounts Indicate Cautious Consumer Spending this Holiday, According to New Impact Analytics™ Report Overall Smaller Discounts Seen on Essentials with Bigger Discounts on Higher Value Categories Home» Press Release New York, NY—July 18, 2024—Prime Day discounts indicate a need for retailers to prepare for cautious consumers for the coming Holiday season, according to a new report byImpact Analytics ™, the pioneer in AI-powered planning and pricing solutions for the retail, grocery,
and pricing solutions for the retail, grocery, manufacturing, and CPG industries
. The data shows low discounts, of less than 10% on average, in essential categories including Grocery & Gourmet Food; Pet Supplies; Appliances; Baby Products; and Patio, Lawn & Garden. Non-essential and High-Value Categories had significant discounts on Prime Day as well as the highest increase in discounts leading up to prime day. These categories include Electronics; Cell Phones & Accessories; Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry; Tools & Home Improvement; and Sports & Outdoors
. “Given the current macro-economic conditions, Prime Day appeared to strike a delicate balance between maintaining margins and stimulating demand,” said Prashant Agrawal, CEO of Impact Analytics. “Our data shows a high concentration of lower discounts on everyday essentials, indicating that pricing might not have a strong impact on buyer behavior for these items, which may reflect ongoing inflationary pressures and stable demand in these segments
. Retailers must start preparing now to navigate these conditions effectively not only to serve a cautious consumer this holiday but also to ensure they are ready to weather future market dynamics and uncertainty.” Significantly, 81% of Grocery & Gourmet Food items were not included in the Prime Day Sale, while, on the opposite end of the spectrum, only 41% of Electronics, 45% of Cell Phones & Accessories, and 50% of Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry were not marked down
. The report also shows that Prime Day 2024 had deeper promotions compared to previous years’ events across most categories. The top categories with the steepest increase in promotions compared to Prime Day 2023 include Appliances +8% (24% vs 16%); Cell Phones & Accessories 6% (28% vs 22%); Electronics +4% (34% vs 30%). The categories with the steepest decrease in promotions include Beauty and Personal Care -5% (29% vs 34%); and Grocery & Gourmet Food -1% (23% vs 25%)
. Comparing 2024’s Amazon Prime Day with Walmart Deals, the discounts offered by both events were similar for categories including Appliances; Electronics; Grocery & Gourmet Food; and Sports & Outdoor. Walmart Deals offered significantly deeper discounts in the Home & Kitchen category at 36% compared to Amazon Prime’s 27%. Read the full reporthere.

High Use of Ozempic and Other Diabetes Drugs for Weight Loss Driving Down Clothing Sizes In New York City, According to New Study Report from Impact Analytics Cites the Effect Diminishing Size Curves Have on Retail Margins, Using Data from Flagships on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, the Epicenter for Non-Diabetic Use of GLP-1 Drugs Home» Press Release NEW YORK, June 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The effects of the increasing use of GLP-1 diabetes drugs including Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss has triggered
Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss has triggered an expensive problem for retailers: incorrect size curves
. Impact Analytics, an AI-based retail planning and forecasting company, announced today that size small has become the most popular size for women on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, the epicenter of non-diabetic use of GLP-1 drugs. Compared to 2022, sales of women’s button-down shirts in small sizes (XXS, XS, and S) has increased in 2024 by 12%; and sales of large sizes (XXL, XL, and L) has decreased by nearly 11% (10.9%)
. This data has broad bottom-line implications for high-end clothing retailers that primarily serve women over the age of 30 in urban areas. “The slimming down of America will have an enormous impact on retailers and could cost them approximately $20 million each year due to incorrect size curves. These losses will only accelerate as more people take GLP-1 drugs for weight loss,” said Prashant Agrawal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Impact Analytics
. “Retailers generally make buying decisions for upcoming seasons at least six months in advance, and if this impact to the curve isn’t addressed, it will have ramifications on retail sales that will extend well into the holiday season and beyond.” New York City leads the world not only in fashion but also in GLP-1 drug usage. Nearly 44% of the city’s GLP-1 prescriptions go to New Yorkers who do not have a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis. This demographic skews younger and nearly 75% are female
. Impact Analytics observed that the GLP-1 drug prescriptions in New York City coalesce in the affluent neighborhood of Manhattan’s Upper East Side. This usage concentration provided a unique opportunity to examine its retail impact. The Impact Analytics data scientists examined multi-year sales from 2022 to 2024 at flagship stores of fashion apparel retailers prominently situated on NYC’s Upper East Side
. In 2022, sales of women’s button-down shirts in size small (S) were 25% of sales and have increased in 2024 to 31% of sales. A similar shift in the size curve was seen across women’s and men’s apparel. This data spurred Impact Analytics to focus their analysis on shifts in clothing size curves, which reflect both the absolute and relative amounts of particular apparel sizes bought by consumers. Shifting size curves indicate a change in customers’ body sizes
. “Most retailers have clung to the same size curves for years despite evidence suggesting their inaccuracy,” said Agrawal. “The impact of that will continue to erode retailer margin integrity unless immediate action is taken to update them.” Size curves are specific to each product type and influence which sizes are included in the assortment as well as the quantity of each size ordered
. Poor size curves directly impact the buying and allocation processes, resulting in lost sales due to stockouts and excesses in inventories that are subsequently marked down. For a billion-dollar business, over the next five to ten years, even a 2 percent transition to lower sizes can significantly impact profitability, potentially turning margins negative. This could result in a reduction of tens of millions of dollars. For more information, download the full reporthere
. Methodology Impact Analytics implemented a comprehensive methodology for calculating size curves to ensure robust and consistent insights at both the product and category levels. Focus stores in specific geographies, such as NYC’s Upper East Side, were considered. The calculation of size curves started with sales data (units), which was then supplemented with lost sales data. Lost sales were meticulously calculated at the most granular level—product x size x store x day—to ensure accuracy
. Adjustments for stock-outs were made to prevent misinterpretation of size curves due to inventory shortages. This methodology included a multi-year analysis, covering 2022, 2023, and up to April 2024, allowing for the identification of insights over time.
